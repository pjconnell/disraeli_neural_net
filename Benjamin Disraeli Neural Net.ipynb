Then, the Disraeli-bot will spit out up to the next 25 words that Gmail would suggest continuing with (the suggestion powered by the neural net trained on Disraeli's correspondence) provided the confidence level in the prediction does not fall below a specified level (I put the default at 50%, but you can tweak that by changing the \"threshold=0.X\" argument).\n",

You probably understand much better what the content is, but it looks to me like this is a lot of personal correspondence, so perhaps not super topical for our purposes? Also of note - I didn't get a chance to clean the letters yet, so the footnote annotations and \"EBSCO Host checked out to paul.connell@columbia.edu\", etc. are, unfortunately, included in the nerual net. These are all things that we can fix easily, but take time. Also, the more letters we can feed it (I hit my max allowance of 100 pages/day) the better the performance will get."
