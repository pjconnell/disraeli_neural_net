You probably understand much better what the content is, but it looks to me like this is a lot of personal correspondence, so perhaps not super topical for our purposes? Also of note - I didn't get a chance to clean the letters yet, so the footnotes and \"EBSCO Host checked out to paul.connell@columbia.edu\" etc. are, unfortunately, included in the nerual net. These are all things that we can fix easily, but take time - also, the more letters we can feed it (I hit my max allowance of 100 pages/day) the better the performance will get."
