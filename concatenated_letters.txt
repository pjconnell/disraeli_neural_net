EDITORIAL COMMENT: There is no salutation. Sic: Thuilleries.

Paris. Jany. 1. 1857
I wish you a happy New Year from the Imperial City.

It is the first letter, that I have written this year, & I will accept it as a good
omen, that it is addressed to Mount Braddon.

Ten years, / as long as the siege of Troy, since I found myself last in this place.
Troy could not be more changed in the time. Everything squalid has been pulled
down, or driven out of sight — a city of palaces & glittering streets, & illimitable
parks & pleasure gardens, & lakes & / gondolas, & beautiful birds & deer. The
Thuilleries & Louvre, joined, form a kingly residence worthy of Babylon: the Rue
de Rivoli, with its bright arcades, extends from the Place de la Concorde & the
Elysian fields, to the Hotel de Ville & Notre Dame: the old Bois de / Boulogne is
converted into a Paradise, compared with wh:, in extent, all the Parks in London,
together, would form an insignificant section. '

Paris is a beautiful woman, & London an ugly man = still, the masculine quality
counts for something.”

Our reception here has not turned our heads, but / has tried the strength of our
constitutions. Once, we dined out eleven days running.” The Ministers here live
in palaces, with appointments & service, quite as gorgeous & stately, as our own
Court — very different from the position of English Ministers. Nevertheless I don’t
think English / gentlemen would ever feel easy under roofs, wh: were not their
own, however splendid. They would think, they were too much like the Lord
Mayor.’

Our most interesting dinner was, however, certainly at the Thuilleries,’ for my wife
sate by the Emperor, & / I sate by the side of the beautiful Empress: I have seen such
faces, often, among the ladies at a bull fight — & I dare say many a Mendez da Costa
has worn such, Her Round her swanlike neck she wore a necklace of emeralds &
diamonds such as might have been found in the cave of Aladdeen; &, / yet, tho’
colossal gems, for her, they were not too vast. After this, I will tell you no more — the
curtain shd. fall amid the brightest fire.

1 Paris was extensively rebuilt by Napoleon III under the supervision of Baron Haussmann, prefect of the
Seine 1853; much of the work was completed in late 1856 and early 1857, coinciding with the Ds’ visit.
One of Napoleon’s motives was to make the boulevards too broad for barricades to be easily erected.
New Cambridge Modern History X 460.

2 Evidently D was pleased with this bon mot; cf V1 2880, 2881 and, in this volume, (app 1) 2881X, 2884, 2885
and 2886.

3 A list of the Ds’ social engagements in Paris from (30) November to 29 December has an entry for every
day except 6, 11-13, 15 and 20 December. H D/IV/H/35.

4 The Mansion House is the residence during the year in office of the Lord Mayor of London; in 1856-7
he was Thomas Quested Finnis, a merchant.

5 The Ds dined at the Tuileries on 3 December and attended a soirée there on the 18th; their last Paris
engagement would be a grand ball at the Tuileries on 15 January. H D/IV/H/35.

Hotel Brighton. R. Rivoli | Jan. 1. 1857.
My dear Jolliffe,
Your faithful handwriting’ met my eye this morning, &, by return of post, I wish
you a happy new year from the imperial city. It has surprised me after an
absence as long as the siege of Troy. Paris is a / beautiful woman, & London
an ugly man, but the masculine quality is not to be despised.

What you tell me is good. Altho’ very much engaged here, I have not been idle
as to domestic affairs altogether.” I wrote, a week ago, to Granby, Blandford,
March, & Lovaine, & one or two others, requesting / their company on the 2nd.
Feb: but I have received no reply from any of them,” wh: is inconvenient, altho’
my bag from G. Gate arrived here this morning. Their answers were to be addressed there, as the P.O. here, they say, is not too safe. I shall, however, trust it
today in yr. instance. My bag arrives fitfully, as it depends upon / the couriers of
the friends who aid me, & wh: are irregular.’

Yours ever, | D.

I can’t hear too frequently - but I don’t suppose I shall be here much more than
another ten days.”

6 SBW on 12 January thanked D for the letter, the first she had received in 1857: “Your views of Paris
remind me of Contarinis charming poetic scenes on his route to Venice ...’ In a postscript she asked
D to thank Ma ‘for the finest Woodcocks I ever tasted like all the good things you spoil me with’, and
concluded: ‘I am quite as well as usual.’ RTC [300Q].

1 Jolliffe on 27 December had reported stirring Derby into action in anticipation of a general election;
see VI 2877n2.

2 In addition to his heavy social schedule and conversations with Napoleon Ill (see M&B IV 56-8), D was
arranging to be kept informed about “domestic affairs’ such as confidential embassy business; see VI
2880n2. Also, he was keeping himself informed on more private matters; Rose on 2 January 1857 would
report on the ‘treachery’ of D’s tenant George Hussey in a matter before the tithe commissioners,
despite which (Rose had learned) they were ruling in D’s favour on ‘all the main points’. H R/I/B/28.

3 For D’s Christmas Day letters to Granby and to Lovaine see vi 28818n1 and (app I) 2881X; his letters
to the others have not been found. Lovaine would accept D’s invitation on 2 January and Granby on 5
January. H B/XXI/L/344, R/338. March and Lovaine would be among the 45 MPs who attended the
2 February dinner to discuss the Queen’s speech; Granby, being prevented by the death of his father,
would be one of the six who sent regrets. MP (3 Feb 1857).

4 The ‘friends’ were the Rothschilds; see 2894.

5 Jolliffe from Petersfield on 5 January (D’s letter had arrived the day before) said he would now write
often, and asked if there was anything he could do about ‘these noble Lords [who] do not answer their
invitations ...” H B/XX/J/42.

ORIGINAL: DUR D/LO/C 172 [148]
EDITORIAL COMMENT: There is no salutation. Sze: Thuilleries; Waleskis.

Paris — Jan: 3. 1857
I send you the Compliments of the season from the Imperial City. As I have not
been here for a period as long as the siege of Troy, you may suppose that I find
some changes both material & moral. Of the excellence of the former, I think
there can / be little question. Paris is a beautiful woman, & London is an ugly
man: nevertheless, the masculine quality is not to be despised.

I found the Emperor extremely well: I shd. say, in excellent health: a little
stouter than of yore; a rounder face; no wrinkles; & with that animated mien, wh:
prosperity & success inspire. I had the honor of sitting next to / the Empress at
dinner. She was gay & gracious. I have seen such faces at a bullfight; where the
Spanish ladies sit. She wore a necklace of colossal emeralds & brilliants; as large as
the gems in the cave of Aladdeen.

Nothing has struck me more, than the beauty of the horses in this city.

The Ministers live here in palaces with appointments, & service, not inferior to
those of their sovereign, or even of our own royalty. We dined one day with /
Fould,' who #ves dwells in a pavilion of the Thuilleries: a banquet of 50 persons.
I never saw anything more gorgeous. The Waleskis not less superb.* I doubt,
however, whether our English ministers would be quite at ease under any roof,
except their own. They would feel too much like the Lord Mayor.

At the Hollands, I made the acquaintance of Prince Napoleon:’ the Prince, they
say, of mauvais sujets: | have seldom met a wilttier, &, rarely, apparently, a wiser man
— but they tell me it was all a performance, & that he is a Borgia. What, however, is
that to you or me? All that we require of our acquaintance is that they shall be agreeable. You must require more than that from me, because I am your friend.*

D.

The Ds dined with Fould, the prime minister, on 24 December. H D/IV/H/35.

2 The Ds attended Countess Walewski’s soirées on 1 and 22 December and would be her dinner guests
on 5 January. H D/IV/H/ 35.

3 4th Baron Holland in 1833 had married Lady Mary Augusta Coventry (1812-1889), only daughter of 8th
Earl of Coventry. See VI 2570n1 for Lennox’s attempts to get D and the Hollands together. Holland's
invitation to D on 1 December anticipated ‘the pleasure of making an acquaintance we have so long
desired .... On 27 December he had written: ‘Prince Napoleon has let me know this morning that he
will dine here at 7 tomorrow so I hope you will be able to come and meet him as he is very anxious to
make your acquaintance and looks forward to this opportunity of doing so.’ H B/XXI/H/582, 584. The
Ds dined with the Hollands on 4, 17, 28 December and 12 January, and they went to Lady Holland’s on
Christmas Day after dinner with the Cowleys. They would be Prince Napoleon’s dinner guests on 10
January. H D/IV/H/35.

4 Lady Londonderry (who in a recent note docketed by MA ‘1856 Novr 18th March of Londonderry’ had

asked D: ‘Would you come & see me ~ late’) seems at this point to have needed this reassurance. Her

13 December letter from Seaham refers enigmatically to D’s ‘advice’ (possibly on a court case involving

her son Ernest): ‘What can I tell you from here - you in the midst of excitement & interest I in the

midst of all that is bleak & dull.’ She had been very ill after D left (‘poisoned with paint and broken
down with worry’), but had got ‘a very clever man here’ to help her with ‘a deal that was unmanageable’
because figures were not her ‘vocation ... He is a gt snob — drops his H’s puts his knife in his mouth

& such like but what does it signify. He is a gt. admirer of yours & said today at dinner he wished you

ORIGINAL: DBP [1544]

PUBLICATION HISTORY: M&B IV 60-1, dated 23 January 1857 at Grosvenor Gate, with some differences
and omissions

EDITORIAL COMMENT: Endorsed by Stanley on the first page: ‘D. JAN. 57.’ There is a much-altered
draft in D’s hand in H B/H/42, the basis of the M&B version.

 

Grosvenor Gate | Friday morning. Jany. 23. 57
Lord Stanley, | M.P.
My dear Stanley,
Your letter, this instant received, greatly afflicts me.!

Certainly, if I had contemplated your refusal, I should not have ventured on
soliciting the presence of the chief followers of your father, for I am quite sure,
that your absence, under such circumstances, would injure him much more, than
the gathering, however numerous & influential, of / others, would bear him
benefit.

I wrote to you, & three more persons, before I sent out the general invitations.
They answered me by return of post; I still waited a week, & as no reply came from
you, I construed your silence favorably, & consonant with your declaration to me
last year, that so long as your father retained the position wh: he now occupies,
your presence, on such an occasion, might be counted on.

With respect to requesting your reply to be sent to Grosvenor Gate, that was not
because it was held unimportant, but because my letters being opened by the
French P.O., / it was necessary, that they should be forwarded to me, wh: they were
regularly, by Rothschild’s couriers.

These few words as to the political considerations, wh: yr letter calls forth. Grave
as they are, they are slight compared with the sad impression, that its tone involves
a sentiment of personal estrangement. As I am not conscious, that I have ever been
wanting in that feeling of deep attachment & high appreciation, wh: I have, new
for many years, entertained for you, I cannot conceal, that my feelings are deeply
wounded. My friendships, tho’ I have to deal with many men, are rare, / I counted
yours among my chief & most enduring possessions, & netst notwithstanding the
many circumstances, public & private, wh: might, for the moment, modify, or
diminish, our intimacy, I had such confidence in the depth & stability of your
character, that I have ever looked forward to our mutual relations as forming
furnishing, during the remaining years of my life, one of the my chief sources of
interest in existence.

Stanley on 22 January at Knowsley had written to decline D’s invitation (2886), as he probably would not
be in London that day: ‘I delayed my answer, hearing you were still at Paris.’ H B/XX/S/627.

Stanley replied at length from St James’s Square on 27 January; see M&B IV 61-3 for a substantial extract.
He apologized for his handling of the invitation, protested his enduring friendship, and then explained
why ‘within the last two years any semblance of alienation has arisen between us,’ namely, his increasing
divergence from the ‘agricultural Conservatism’ that D represented on topics such as ‘Church rates,
religious tests in Parliament, religious tests for the Universities, the repeal of the newspaper stamp, the
constitution of the army, the constitution of the civil service, Irish education, [and] English education’.

Confidential Grosvenor Gate | Jan: 25. 1857
Henry Padwick Esqr

My dear Sir,

I have been so much pressed with public business, since we talked together, that
it has been quite out of my power to seize an hour to prepare for you the information I promised. I now enclose it, not in the ample & businesslike manner I could
have wished, but complete as to the facts, & as I place the matter before / you not
in a professional capacity, wh:, as you properly observed, you no longer fill,’ but
as my friend, these absences of form will matter less, & little.

Do not communicate, when you have occasion to Grosvenor Gate on this subject
except in person. If you have occasion to write to me, otherwise than making an
appointment, write to me at / the Carlton.”

The initial letters in the schedule of Mrs. D’s income, wh: appear somewhat
mysterious (D. & G.) are the initials of the different bankers, (Drummonds & Glyn)
who receive the various funds.

Yours sincerely, | D.

I shall be very much engaged for the next week or ten days — after that, comparatively free, or rather freer.

T.O. /
The affairs wd. require much illustrative conversation, when you have digested
them.

Mem: the surplus income to count on is £3000 pr ann: /

Strictly confidential

compels you to acquiesce’, but had declined being D’s ‘POLITICAL guest’ for fear of being more of an
embarrassment than a help to D. Nevertheless, he would accept D’s invitation ‘with personal pleasure’
if renewed despite his position, and on 29 January he did so; see 2900&n2. H B/XX/S/628. See also
Disraeli, Derby 148.

pd

Padwick had been employed by Lord Jersey to work with D in the Villiers affair; see VI 2764n1. Contra
that note, the Henry Padwick with whom D has had dealings since 1855 was Henry Padwick senior (18051879), not his only son, the barrister of the same name. Padwick pére, sometimes signing himself ‘H.].
Padwick’, of the Manor House, Horsham, Sussex, a solicitor (retired 1855), JP for London and Westminster, DL for Sussex, deputy keeper of Holyrood palace, Scotland, had been in horse racing (under the
name Howard) since 1849; in 1854, for example, he had won (on Virago) and lost (on the stock
exchange) £80,000. He was also ‘a well known money lender’. He resided at 2 Hill Street, Berkeley
Square (at 4 Hill Street after 1868). His few letters to D show him to be a man of the turf on social
terms with the aristocracy, placing bets of the order of £1,500 and evidently handling bets for D as well.
In the 1859 election he would stand unsuccessfully for Bridgwater as a Conservative. Boase; H B/XXI/P/319; Law List (1852); LPOD (1856). See further 32428&n1.

2 Judging from the fact that his letters in H make no reference to the matters described in this letter,
Padwick followed these instructions scrupulously.

My dear Pakington,

The matter, you write to me on, is of too grave a character to be discussed in a
correspondence, necessarily hurried at a moment when I am pressed / with
affairs."

Involving as it does the possible loss, for me, of the ablest, readiest, & most
faithful, of my colleagues in the parliamentary strife, it is natural, that I should not
read & receive yr letter witht. emotion[.]

I am / opposed to all secessions from the front bench of an opposition. They
never are happy in their results, & are always imputed to unworthy motives, or
looked on as a coup de theatre[.]

The affair is not urgent. However important the question, the country is not
particularly disposed at present for its revival. It requires / to digest the past, & I
think, myself, a new parliament wd. have been a happier scene for the introduction.

However, under any circumstances, even if it were our cheval de battaile as a party,
I shd. not recommend an immediate notice to be given, or any until the financial
position of the government / & the House becomes more clear. It is now critical,
& if we play our cards with dexterity & courage, I think even the month of Feby.
may witness some change.

At all events, I / shall count on your presence on the 2nd, particularly as under
my roof you will never meet the grim ferm visage of our amiable colleague, Henley.

Yours very sincerely, | D.?

Pakington was again trying to introduce an education bill; see vi 2710&n1 and 2719&n@2 for his failed
attempt in 1855. On 19 November 1856 at the Manchester Athenzum he had argued that the education
system could no longer be sustained by voluntary effort, and although he was not in favour of a grand,
uniform centralized system, he believed it to be prudent to assist and supplement the existing state of
things. On 21 January, while a guest at Knowsley, he had attended a meeting of the General Committee
on Education in Manchester and Salford, and would again on 6 February. The Times (20 Nov 1856,
22 Jan, 9 Feb 1857). Having on 11 January accepted D’s invitation for 2 February, he had described on
23 January ‘a long conversation’ with Derby at Knowsley ‘on the subject of my position in connection
with the question of education, and the embarrassment which has been caused by Henley’s strong &
active Opposition to my views ...’ If Derby, D and the opposition ‘cabinet’ thought national education
too important to be treated as an open question, he would move his intended bill from another seat.
On the 26th he had just received ‘a full and very kind answer from Lord Derby [who] wishes, very
naturally, to consult his friends before any decision is taken ...’ H B/XX/P/28-30. Meanwhile Derby on
the 23rd had also written to D about Pakington’s visit (Walpole and Lytton had also been at Knowsley):
*,.. Iam sorry to see that Pakington is hampered by his engagements with the Manchester folks on the
Subject of Education.’ He expected to see D at Burghley: ‘I hope you are not come home entirely
imbued with the French views of our foreign Policy.’ On the 25th Derby acknowledged receiving that
morning D’s ‘two notes’ (not found), and enclosed a long letter from Pakington with a draft of his bill;
Derby had advised Pakington to do nothing hastily, to attend D’s dinner and to explain his position to
his ‘quondam Colleagues’ before deciding what his future relations to the party should be. H B/XX/S/
140-1. See further 2898&nn1&2.

2 Pakington would attend D’s dinner on 2 February, but the next day gave notice, as in his last letter to
D (n1) he had said he would, that on the 17th he would move for leave to bring in a bill for the
promotion of elementary education in cities and corporate towns. Henley did not attend the dinner.

The Rt Honble | The Earl of Derby Jany. 28 1857

My dear Lord,

The Haunch has arrived, & I thank you much.!

I saw Jolliffe last night, & told him a great deal on wh: I don’t like to trust the /
post. He will communicate all to you, wh: will prepare you, in some degree, for our

Two days ago, I wrote to Pakington, that if ever his measure were the cheval de

Wednesday | Jan 28.
My dear Sa,
Tho’ a bad letter-writer, [ send you a line to remind you of my existence.
This sorrow of James’ is a great calamity / — & it is impossible to know what to
do. It certainly does not appear to me, that in the first instance, there was proper
advice. I hope at present, there is no ground / for a similar apprehension.’

1 See 2897n1. On the 27th Derby had sent D another letter from Pakington just received: ‘We must try
to prevent his giving his notice on the first day; and I think it would be useful if we were to have a
meeting with him & Henley [,] Walpole & Lytton on Monday - which will either lead to an understanding or a crisis.. H B/XX/S/142.

2 Russell on 6 March 1856 (see VI 2841n1), with approving reference to Pakington’s failed bill of 1855,
had introduced 12 resolutions for a system of state education; this led to an acrimonious debate and
the withdrawal for the time being of the resolutions. Hansard CXLI cols 779-867, 889-963.

Isabella Disraeli was most likely suffering from tuberculosis exacerbated by pregnancy. At the time it was
thought she had chronic bronchitis contracted at the time of her marriage to James Disraeli; see VI
2880&n1. She would write to D on 29 January: ‘I wish I could give you a more favourable answer to your
very kind inquiries after my health but it seems that Bronchitis is no easy tenant to get rid of ... [am
under a very clever physician ... & follow out his instructions very strictly. I dont talk, keep to two rooms,

I wd. not call on Made. Lieven when I was at Paris, wh: I believed vexed her —
but I had my reasons — & now she is dead: tho’ 75, very unexpected.”

At / Paris, of late, they only talked of Sir R. Peel. The fashion was to pity poor
Lord Granville, because what Sir R. said must have been the common conversation
of His Excellency’s table. For my part, I thought Peel’s speech as stupid, — as it was
vulgar & impudent. It / was like a servant talking in the Hall of his Masters & de
Mistresses.

The best joke is, — the dinner at 60£ pr head [two words inserted:] or 50, was Lord
Granville’s dinner, & Peel never paid a farthing.

The Prince de Ligne in private said “all that my family knew of this person / was,
that he borrowed 2000 roubles one night at hazard of my son, & left Moscow
without remembering to repay them.[”] I saw the sister of the “Brick” at Paris; the
Princess Radziwill, the most charming woman in the world, & an old friend of
mine, tho’ when she spoke / to me one night I had quite forgotten her — to my
shame.

The Gen). Sourokoff is a gentleman & a great breeder of horses, the most
famous in Russia. He brought four white horses to Moscow for sale of unrivalled
beauty. Peel took them on trial with the avowed intention of purchasing, / kept
them three weeks, & then returned them as not suited to his purpose. The General’s market having been lost, he brought an action for damages, & got £100 pr
horse — this is the foundation of the story.”

inhale the steam of hops several times a day, with divers other tortures ...’ She sent regards to MA and
hoped D's ‘banquet’ would ‘go off most brilliantly.” H D/UI/B/92. Advice from Dr Gerald A. Evans
(Department of Infectious Diseases, Queen’s University) is that, in some women with active tuberculosis,
pregnancy is a direct cause of physical deterioration, especially in the first four months (when the
immune system is under severe strain) and the first month after delivery. See also Sir William Osler
Principles and Practice of Medicine (1892) 247, and C.G. Barnes Medical Disorders in Obstetric Practice (1962)
go-1. See further 2914&n1}.

2 The Princess de Lieven had died in Paris on the evening of 26 January. For a lengthy appreciation of
her life see Greville vil 258-65 where her reputation as ‘a mischievous intriguer’ is pooh-poohed. Because
as a Russian she was latterly in Paris only on French sufferance, D probably did not want to risk his good
standing with the Emperor by associating with her, although her long close friendship with Aberdeen
would not have recommended her to him either; see VI 25678&n3.

3 Sir Robert Peel, civil lord of the admiralty, on 6 January at the opening of the Adderley Park Library
in Birmingham had given (according to MP) ‘a very colloquial and humorous’ lecture about his recent
adventures as attaché to Lord Granville, the Queen’s representative at the Czar’s coronation on 7
September 1856. Peel had been ‘horribly fleeced’ by an innkeeper at St Petersburg; ‘... our dinner every
night cost us £60 sterling.’ At Moscow he had ‘made an agreement with General Sourochokoff, a
common man, whose whole anxiety was to impose upon people who trusted in him. At my command
he had sent for me to the station a magnificent carriage with four magnificent grey horses ... [He]
charged me £10 for the hire of each horse ...’ Peel had gone on to Nizhny Novgorod (now Gorky),
where at the theatre he met the ‘Governor’, a ‘“brick” ... I never saw a man with such a capacity for
drinking as this “brick” of a Governor ...’ At the coronation Peel had been amused to see ‘the Ambassador of the smallest kingdom in Europe, Belgium, the Prince de Ligne, the very picture of swelling
insignificance .... He continued: ‘As the Empress entered she fell flat on the floor, I supposed by
accident. It was, however, to kiss some sacred stone or other ... At the moment when the Emperor
forced his crown on his head the imperial ermine fell to his feet, while that of the Empress fell from
her head, and was broken into pieces.’ MP (7, 8 Jan 1857). The Prince de Ligne (for whom see IV
1270n10), who in 1838 had also represented Belgium at Victoria’s coronation, had been ambassador to
Russia since 1856. Biographie Générale XXXI-II (Paris 1862). The brother of Princess Radziwill (for whom
see IV 1431&n2) was Prince Edmond Clary-Aldringen (1813-1894), ‘Chambellan 4 la Cour d’Autriche’.

with Gladstone see 2907&n1, 2908&nn1&2 and 2910&nn1&2. See VI 2517n4 and 2526n: for Gladstone’s
1853 renewal of the income tax for seven years at a rate diminishing to 4d in the pound in 1857 and
remaining at that level until 1860; Lewis proposed to set it at 7d. For Gladstone’s budget of March 1854
and the supplementary budget two months later (‘the 2dy Act’), in which he doubled the income tax
and then issued exchequer bonds to pay for the war, see VI 2643n2 and 2653n1; the second act (in an
‘equivocal’ manner, D would charge on 20 February) also doubled the duration of the war income tax
to two years after the end of the war. Derby had written this day (8 February) from St James’s Square:
‘I send you a note which I have just received from Gladstone: my answer is that I have not seen you
since the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s notice [on 6 February that he would on Monday or Tuesday fix the
day for his financial statement], but that 1 apprehend it will make no difference in the substance, if it does
in the form of your motion, unless he concedes both points, viz: the immediate abandonment of the
War addition, and the final extinction of the Tax in 1860. By the way, I think the Chancellor’s announcement may be a very good ground for your delaying to state the precise terms of your notice, if
you are so disposed. You have not sent in your idea of the form.’ H B/XX/S/145; Hansard CXLIV cols 2523. The ‘enclosed’ may have been G.A. Hamilton’s letter to D also of this day strongly recommending
‘that your question ought not to be mixed up with that of the Finance of the coming year.’ H
B/XX/H/96. For a treatment of the Gladstone/Conservative party relationship at this time, see H.C.G.
Matthew Gladstone 1809-1874 (Oxford 1986) 106-7: ‘His personal inclination in the period 1855 to 1859
lay on the whole with the Conservatives ... but ... he had little inumacy with Conservatives of Cabinet
rank ... Gladstone, however, consistently argued that the problem of party ... could not be solved by
men, but by measures. By measures, he meant the fulfilment of the programme of financial reform
which he worked out in February 1856. Other Peelites, however, without exception worked to push him
away from Derby ...’

2 See 2903&n3. Derby (n1) had also written: ‘Have you heard any more from your informant as to the
guarantee? It has crossed my mind whether you may have been misled by an offer which | believe
certainly was made by France, when Austria was on the point of joining her forces to ours, that She
would guarantee her Italian Dominions, during the time the Austrian Troops might be so engaged, against the
consequences of their withdrawal — but the Expedition to the Crimea was resolved on, Austria withdrew
her offer, and the whole agreement fell to the ground. I hope this is not your Informant’s basis.’ Ralph
Earle had sent D an undated ‘Copy’ of a letter addressed ‘My dear E’: ‘I wd. suggest that something
should be said about the perfidy of Ld. P, who, having encouraged the Italians to cherish schemes of
national independence, never attempted to obtain the publication of the secret treaty ... [and] allowed
the Italian liberals to fight on, under the masked battery of France. How many plots, how many
assassinations &c &c wd the publication of that treaty have spared!’ Another ‘Copy’, dated 5 February
1857 at Paris, reads: “The secret treaty was so framed as to show that it owed its existence to the secret
article [regarding Austria's possible participation in the war] in the tripartite treaty [of 2 December
1854; see VI 2717n2). Itis possible ... that the treaty between Austria & France was only to remain in force
as long as the treaty of the 2nd. Decr. continued to be binding on the 3 powers ... However, the treaty
of the 2nd. Decr. proved inoperative & I conclude that Austria obtained the guarantee, without
contracting any substantial engagement in return ... The treaty was signed a little before Xmas day
perhaps on the 22nd. of DECR ...’ H B/XX/E/4-5. On Monday 9 February, when he was assured that
Palmerston would be in the House the next day, D gave notice that he would at that time ‘make some
observations upon a contradiction which I received from him on the first evening of our meeting on
a matter of great moment.’ MP (10 Feb 1857). See further 2907&n2. For a possible identification of D’s
and Earle’s informant see Blake 371.

The Rt Hon | The Earl of Derby
My dear Lord,
I was working at the Income Tax when your packet arrived. I cannot return it by
the messenger, as it requires deep consideration, but / will endeavour to forward
it in an hour or two.!

The written Instrument between France & Austria is a “TREATY”

is signed;

: has been acted on;
& / contains no limitation on its surface.”

Yours sincerely, | D.

1 The tone and details of this letter fit well the speech D made against advice on 10 February 1857; see
2907&n2. MC (11 Feb 1857) records that the House adjourned at 8:35 on this date.

Derby had written on this day (11 February): ‘As I hope you will now be able to turn your attention to
the subject of the Income Tax, I send you, confidentially, four Resolutions which Gladstone left with
me yesterday, as embodying not only his own views, but those of Sidney Herbert & Graham, and a
Memorandum which he left with them. I told him that we should come to no decision till after the
Budget on Friday.’ He also enclosed a copy of his letter to Gladstone written after reading the resolutions, and asked that Gladstone’s papers be returned. H B/XX/S/146. See further 29088n1.

2 In the House the previous evening D had returned to his secret treaty allegations (see 2903&n3 and
2905&n2), stating that the guarantee had been successfully negotiated and put in wridng, had been
signed on 22 December 1854, and subsequently had been extensively acted upon with the full knowledge
of the Briush government; he challenged Palmerston to give him access to the foreign office papers for
December 1854 and January 1855 to document his statement. Palmerston replied that a convention to
have effect only during the war might have been considered, but that it was never signed, and therefore
he had been correct in stating that no treaty such as D described existed. Hansard CXLIV cols 458-72 (D
458-67). Evidently b had received the copy of Earle's informant’s letter dated 10 February in Paris, which
also mentions ‘two telegraphic messages, which I sent yesterday ... [and] two letters on Monday morning
& two on Monday evening’; three letters in H, dated 8, 9 and 10 February (the first and third marked

The Rt Honble | The Earl of Derby
My dear Lord,
I highly approve of your letter to G[ladstone],’ & I think, that the Resolutions, as
at present drawn, would alarm, & repel support. I propose, with great diffidence,
for your consideration: /

ist. That the first resolution shd. be adopted.

“whether”, in second line, to the words “tax or taxes” in ninth line[.]

And that the fourth shd be adopted to please G.

Yours ever, | D. P.S. /

‘Copy’, the second a letter from Earle to D signed ‘Your effte’), contain most of the substance of D’s
speech. Derby (n1) had added a postscript: “Your Treaty appears to have been what I was afraid it would
turn out to be — the old arrangement limited to the war, and according to Palmerston, never executed.’
On 12 February Palmerston would concede that a ‘convention’ had been signed, but insist that it had
never come into effect, while D would reiterate the allegations here itemized; see 29098&n1. H B/XX/E/79; Hansard CXLIV cols 535-9 (D 536-7, 538).

3 Derby (n1) had hoped D would attend a noon meeting he was having on Saturday with ‘those who were
here yesterday ... [to] decide upon our course.’ The meeting would comprise Derby, Malmesbury,
Hardwicke, D, Pakington, Walpole and Lytton. Gladstone Diaries v 198. Prince Albert at 11:00 am on
Saturday morning, 14 February, at the Palace of Westminister would preside at a meeting of the royal
commission for the 1851 exhibition; neither Derby nor D attended. MP (16 Feb 1857).

See 2907&n1. Derby had written to Gladstone: *‘... the 2nd & 3rd Resolutions, and more especially the
2nd, not only point distinctly to an infraction of the implied engagement that the Income Tax should
terminate in 1860, but also to an alteration of its positive enactments during the term of its continuance;
and this, not to meet any sudden and unforseen emergency, but to enable the Government to reduce
other Taxes, by again raising the Income Tax to its original amount: I think such a measure would be
alike inconsistent with good faith and policy: and if once admitted, it would go far to make the Income
Tax permanent’. Gladstone recorded in his diary on 11 February: ‘I called on Lord Derby at two today
to take a survey of the questions connected with the Budget — especially 1. the motion on Tea & Sugar
Duties 2. the motion on expenditure 3. a motion to impound the outstanding '4 year of 16d Income Tax
for the discharge of Exchequer Bonds or other public engagements 4. a motion — as announced in Lord
D.s letter to me — respecting the introduction of a descending scale into the Income Tax Act.’ Gladstone
Dianes V 196&nng (citing DBP Box 133) &14 (citing BL ADD MSS 44140 f214). Gladstone’s original four
resolutions have not been found, but perhaps they can be inferred from the note he would draft for Derby
on 14 February after their two meetings (see n2): ‘To maintain a steady surplus of income over expenditure — to lower indirect taxes when excessive in amount for the relief of the people and bearing in mind
the reproductive power inherent in such operations — to simplify our fiscal system by concentrating its
pressure on a few well chosen articles of extended consumption ~ and to conciliate support to the Income
Tax by marking its temporary character & by associating it with beneficial changes in the laws; these aims
have been for fifteen years the labour of our life. By the Budget of last night they are in principle utterly
reversed [.]’ Gladstone Diaries V 197. See also H.C.G. Matthew, ‘Disraeli, Gladstone, and the Politics of MidVictorian Budgets’ in Historical Journal 22, 3 (1979) 615-43, at 637.

2 G.A. Hainilton in his 8 February letter (see 2905n1) urging D to propose repeal of the war/income tax
had remarked: ‘And — as Ponsonby said in 1816 — so long as the tax remains there will be no real Peace
Establishment.’ Gladstone on 14 February would record: ‘... I knew from Ld Derby that he was to see
his friends at noon. So I went to him ... to point out the deficit of between 5 & 6 millions for 1858-9
which is created by this Budget ... and secondly to say that in my opinion it was hopeless to attack the
scheme in detail & that tt must be resisted, on the ground of deficit, as a whole, to give a hope of
success ... | again went to Derby as he had requested at five ... They had all agreed that the best motion
would be a resolution (from Disraeli) on Monday ... corresponding with our No. 3 of last Tuesday: which
would virtually rest the question on deficit. | made two verbal suggestions on the Resolution to improve
its form ... He said that the Resolution he proposed if it should be rejected would serve to shield from
responsibility next year those who voted for it if they should then be in office ...” Gladstone Diaries V 1978&n3 (citing BL. ADD MSS 44747 f8}. See further 2g10&nn1&2.

1 See 2907n2. Greville (Vi 267) recorded the House’s response to the ‘very imprudent and very improper’
language Palmerston used in his attempt to remain on the offensive against D’s allegations: *... (unlike
what he had ever experienced before) he sat down without a single cheer, his own people even not
venturing to challenge the approbation of the House in a matter in which, though Disraeli was not
right, P. was so clearly wrong |.

1 See 2908&nn1&2. Derby on this day (‘Saturday’) had written from St James’s Square: ‘] have this
moment seen Gladstone. He had brought another Resolution, but ultimately concurred in the course
we proposed to take. He suggested however an amendment which I have inserted in brackets, and which
I think improves our Resolution by directing attention more immediately to the danger of a deficiency.
I am to let him know tomorrow morning if you approve of the Resolution as amended — in which case
I think we may confidently rely on the active support of himself, Graham, Herbert, and Cardwell. If we
can get F. Baring, we shall have a heavy five.’ H B/XX/S/157. Derby immediately forwarded D’s response
to Gladstone (see ec): ‘“I hope [ may take it for granted that there is now a complete understanding
between us as to the move on Monday night.”” Morley Gladstone 561.

Private Sunday
The Rt Honble. | Earl of Derby

My dear Lord 
I have just come in, & found your note.!

With great deference, you appear to me not to have deducted the million & a
half surplus of 1857-8 from the four / million deficiency of 1858-9. That would
reduce the deficiency to something about what I anticipated. I assumed, at least,
two millions to be dealt with, [date inserted:] in -58-9, by way of reduction: there
wo[ul]d appear / on your figures two millions & a half. I see nothing in these
results to prevent the [word inserted:] course we thought desirable. But I say all this
with great diffidence, not having my papers by / me — Only, I thought before
dinner, I would send you this line.’

Yours sincerely, ! D.

former reads: ‘I am still, as I was yesterday afternoon, doubtful whether the terms of the Resolution,
which with your friends you had then resolved to move, are those best calculated for a clear and telling
exposure of the deficiencies which the Budget will create. As, however, it embodies one of our main
objections to the plan of the Government, and as we concur in the intention to place Parliament in a
condition to remit the Income Tax in 1860, we shall give it our best support ...’ Henley’s note reads:
‘I am not particular about the form of any motion to be made but I am strongly of opinion that the
House of Commons ought not to be pledged to the proposed Budget until they have considered the
estimates for if establishments are to be sanctioned such as are now proposed I see no reason to think
the income Tax can in 1860 be got rid of.’ H B/XX/S/147,a,b. D on Monday 16 February would give
notice and on 20 February move as an amendment to Lewis’s financial statement ‘“That ... it would be
expedient, before sanctioning the financial arrangements for the ensuing year, to adjust the estimated
Income and Expenditure ... to secure the country against the risk of a deficiency in the years 1858-9 and
1859-60, and to provide for such a balance of Revenue and Charge respectively in the year 1860 as may
place it in the power of Parliament at that period ... altogether to remit the Income Tax.” After two
nights of debate, and despite strong support from Gladstone, the resolution was defeated 286-206 on
23 February. Hansard CXLIV col 723, 947-1028 (D 948-71, 972, 976, 983), 1060-1154 (D 1131-2, 1154). See
2908n1 and 2912&n1.

Derby had written on ‘Sunday’ from St James's Square: ‘After you left me, I sat down to calculate the
financial result of the scheme which we talked over; and I am sorry to say it does not come out as
satisfactorily as we had anticipated. You will find my lucubrations on the other side. I wish you may be
able to show me that [ am wrong. The result of your suggestion, as compared with Cornewall Lewis’s
proposal, is that in 1858-9 we should have an Income diminished by 2d. Income Tax = 2,000,000; and
(say) £700,000 Tea duties together 2,700,000: while we should have a diminished Expenditure by
2,000,000 Exchequer Bonds not paid off, and £1,500,000 Sinking Fund not paid together £3,500,000 leaving a balance in our favour, as compared with now, of £800,000 only, against which we should have
to set the interest of Four Million of Exchequer Bonds not redeemed, and we should still have a
deficiency of £4,000,000 to make good by reduction, if we bind ourselves to the principle of No new
Taxes. I do not see, from such a result, how I can urge upon Gladstone a point which he will be very
reluctant to surrender, and tie him to a principle which I think we cannot carry out. At all events I will
not see him till I have heard from, or seen, you again. I wish you may find that I have made a blunder.’
The verso of the first sheet of the letter is covered with Derby’s more detailed calculations by which he
arrives at a projected 1858 net income of £58,800,000, expenditure of £62,850,000, leaving a deficiency
of £4,050,000. H B/XX/S/155.

Cornewall Lewis had given his estimates for these years in the House on 16 February prior to going into
committee of supply; Gladstone chided him for not having included them in his financial statement the
previous Friday (13 February). The figures that D had offered in his speech on Friday turned out to
differ from Lewis’s by £900,000, not ‘a million’, because of a misprint in one of the items in the
estimates. See 2910n2.

2 After many delays (see 2914&n2 and 2916&nn1&2) and discussions on procedure, Lewis on 6 March
would propose the first resolution of his financial statement, reducing the income tax from 16d to 7d
in the pound, the deficiency thus created to be partially offset by suspending for one year the scheduled
decrease in tea duty to 15 5d. Gladstone at that time would make his announced motion on the tea and
sugar duties (that they be 1s 3d) when the House went into committee of ways and means. Hansard
CXLIV cols 1007-18, 2023.

Derby had written on ‘Sunday Night’ from St James’s Square, evidently after reading D’s letter of the
same evening as he marked it ‘Ansd’ (see 2912ec): ‘I am afraid] am right, & you are mistaken. I admit a
surplus in 57/8 of a Million & a half or thereabouts — but that surplus cannot be carried to the credit of
58/9. If it could, no doubt it would diminish the deficiency for that year to 2 Millions, leaving the other
Million & [a] half to be added to the deficiency of the next year ~ but this would be in fact the old story
of borrowing to make good the sinking fund. The utmost, we could say would be that out of the 1/4 Million
surplus, we would pay off a Million of Exchequer Bonds, instead of cancelling other portions of [the]
National debt, postponing for five years the payment of the remaining Million; but that would still leave
us in 58/9 with the deficiency which | estimated in my note of this morning, of Four Millions, even
supposing the postponing operation to be applied to the whole of the Exchequer Bonds falling due in that
year, besides the sinking fund, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has now abandoned for us. If you
can make the case any better, let me see you early tomorrow.’ H B/XX/S/154.

HUGHENDON MANOR, | March 17, 1857.

TO THE | ELECTORS OF THE COUNTY OF BUCKINGHAM.
GENTLEMEN,
The House of Commons having, by a solemn vote, in which the leading men of all
parties concurred, censured the cruel and double-dealing policy pursued by the
agents of the Government towards the Chinese, Parliament has been dissolved.

Since the announcement of the dissolution the Minister has declared that his
Agents in China will be superseded, thus acknowledging the justness of the vote of
the House of Commons.’

1 There is a 12 March 1859 Lovegrove letter to D which sheds some light on D's business with him at this
time each year: ‘It being now about the time of our annual audit &c may I beg the favor of your giving
me half an hour one day next week to go into our matter &c? ...’ H D/N/B/298. The stamp reference
indicates that the ‘enclosed’ is a legal document such as a cheque, such transactions being subject to
taxation.

1 See 2914n2. For a treatment of the late-1856 Arrow incident, in which the British consul at Canton, Harry
Parkes, and the governor of Hong Kong, Sir John Bowring, decided to protect a Chinese pirate ship
flying a British flag under an expired registration, setting off a series of events which culminated in the
bombardment of Canton and all-out war, see Ridley Palmerston 464-70. The cabinet’s decision to support
their agents’ provocative actions led to acrimonious debates in both Houses (D on 3 March calling it
‘an attempt by force to increase our commercial relations with the East’) which ended with Palmerston
on 5 March taking up D’s challenge to call an election. In the debate following his statement that night
he announced that, without undervaluing Bowring’s merits, he planned to send to Peking to negotiate
improved relations with China an emissary who ‘would be likely to carry more weight than any person
who might happen now to be in China’. Hansard CXLIV cols 1155-1245, 1310-88, 1391-1485, 1495-1585,
1589-1684, 1726-1850, 1894-1938 (D 1834-40, 1897-8, quoted at 1836, Palmerston at 1936). Lord Elgin
would supersede Bowring later in 1857.

It is clear, therefore, that the plea for dissolution is a pretext. What then is the
real object?

To waste a year.

Lord PALMERSTON is an eminent man, who has deserved well of his Country;
but as Prime Minister he occupies a false position. He is the Tory chief of a Radical
Cabinet. With no domestic policy, he is obliged to divert the attention of the
people, from the consideration of their own affairs, to the distraction of foreign
politics. His external system is turbulent and aggressive that his rule at home may
be tranquil and unassailed. Hence arise excessive expenditure, heavy taxation, and
the stoppage of all social improvement.’

His scheme of conduct is so devoid of all political principle that when forced to
appeal to the people his only claim to their confidence is his name.”

Such arts and resources may suit the despotic ruler of a Continental State
exhausted by revolutions, but they do not become a British Minister governing a
country proud, free, and progressive, animated by glorious traditions, and aspiring
to future excellence. |

The honour and the best interests of the country require that men should be
returned to the new Parliament with definite principles.* If you will confer on me,
for the fourth time, the high distinction of being your Member, I will, as heretofore, uphold our Constitution in Church and State, and support those popular and
aristocratic Institutions which, in this Country, have made power a privilege, but
have extended the possession of that privilege to all who exert themselves to
deserve it — Institutions which have educated a Nation to aspire and excel.

The general policy which I would enforce at this juncture may be contained in
these words, - Honourable peace, reduced taxation, and social improvement.

There is an attempt at the present day to play off the parties which exist, and
have always to a certain degree existed in the Church, against each other for
political objects. This is a dangerous course for Churchmen to sanction. The
Church which, irrespective of its higher functions, is one of the great guarantees
of English happiness, has foes enough without seeking for them in her own bosom;
and it would appear to me that, instead of quarrelling among themselves, Churchmen should evince mutual forbearance, unite on the common ground of Ecclesiastical Polity, and oppose al] efforts to impair the integrity of that Reformed Church
of England which is the best security for the Religious Liberty of all classes and
creeds of Her Majesty’s subjects.”

I have the honour to remain, | Your obliged and faithful Servant, | B. DISRAELI

2 In his 3 March speech in the China debate (ni) D had characterized Palmerston’s program as ‘“No
Reform! New Taxes! Canton Blazing! Persia Invaded!” (col 1840).

3 D is right in predicting that Palmerston’s name would be the focus of the election (see M&B IV 74).

4 In his speech at Aylesbury after his own election, D in response to a taunt about the general election result
would state (¢f2914&n2): ‘I think the tendency of this dissolution will be to bring back what is necessary
for the good government of this country — two great political parties with definite opinions ... I think there
is nothing more disadvantageous than that the opinions of the foremost man in the country [the prime
minister] ... upon all vital questions should be unknown [or] ... ambiguous ... I think this system, which
prevailed in the last Parliament, would have continued for a very considerable period if the dissolution had
not taken place, but I do not believe that ambiguity can now long exist.’ BH (4 Apr 1857).

5 Palmerston under the influence of his stepson-in-law Shaftesbury was appointing only low-churchmen

PUBLICATION HISTORY: M&B IV 75 dated at Grosvenor Gate 23 March 1857, the fourth and fifth
paragraphs
EDITORIAL COMMENT: Paper imprinted ‘Grosvenor Gate’. There is no salutation.

Mar 23. 1857
I wrote to you at the commencement of a New Year, wh: I hoped might be happy
to both of us. I have no cause to complain of it, but, hitherto, it has brought me
only unceasing / exertion & events. From the day I landed in England, to the
present hour, [I have had not a moments repose — & the present is only a lull
before a more awful struggle.!

as bishops, a policy popular in the country but not with the Church of England or the Conservatives;
Derby in his long 16 March speech in the Lords on second reading of the Income Tax Bill had
regretted that the government appeared to have thrown ‘the whole weight of their influence and
authority into one end of that scale within which the wise latitude of the Church of England allows a
diversity of opinion.’ Hansard CXLIV col 2333; Chadwick I 468-76.

—

Presumably the Charles Lucas who was one of D’s election agents in 1847 (see IV 1537n1), although no
evidence has been found that he participated in the 1857 election on D’s behalf. Possibly he is the
Charles Rose Lucas, solicitor, of Meredith, Reeve, Lucas & Chrimes, solicitors, 8 New Sq, Lincoln’s Inn,
listed in LPOD (1856).

2 Earle’s regular reports from Paris give no hint of this ‘subject’, although on 4 March he had offered to
serve as D’s private secretary if D became foreign secretary, and on 8 March he had written: ‘I have not
forgotten those kind & flattering words, with which you cheered me, when you were here. I would now
remind you of them, as my excuse for asking whether you think it possible that, during the coming
elections, any opportunity will be offered to me.’ He also asked for ‘practical information ... to guide
my financial arrangements.’ On 11 March he had written: ‘Your letter [not found] arrived this morning
& I have lost no time in taking steps to comply with your injunction. Lord Cowley has written to Ld.
Clarendon to ask him to grant me leave of absence. The answer will be favourable, of course, & I shall
be in London on Saturday morning ... Pray let me assure you, once more, of my gratitude, affection and
devotion.’ H B/XX/E/12-15. Ralph Anstruther Earle (1835-1879) was attaché to the British embassy in
Paris 1854-8, D's private secretary 1858-66, Conservative MP for Berwick 1859, for Maldon 1865-8, secretary
to the poor law board 1866-7. He undertook secret missions from D to Napoleon II in 1858 and 1860,
and in 1866 negotiated with the disaffected Liberal ‘Adullamites’ who assisted the Conservative return
to power. Furiously jealous in 1867 over D’s transfer of confidence to Montagu Corry, his new secretary,
he attacked D in the House, effectively ending his own political career.

have been wp unopposed.”

You, also, in Devonshire, are not very tranquil. Buller & Palk in the South
tranquit undisturbed, / but Lady Rolle, in the North, seems in a great bustle,
&, I fear, somewhat in a mess.°

When all the hubbub is over, & men have melted down to their right position in
the new Parliament, I suspect / it will be found, that there is little difference in the
relative strength & influence of parties; & that the same situation will be reproduced.
Identical elements, in due time, will produce / the same results. However a man must
be very prescient, who foresees the consequence of 650 popular elections. An election, a play, a race, a speech — to a certain degree, are always a chance.

Public appeals made in favor / of a name, & not a policy, are convenient, but th, at
the same time, deceptive. A man returned pledged to support Palmerston, really
means nothing, for there is always the proper mental reservation, when Palmerston,
in his, / the pledger’s opinion, is not wrong. It is not like a specific measure, the
ballot &c., wh: admits of no shuffling.

I think the Boroughs will be about the same; many of the Whig counties, robbed
from their lords by the plea of protection, will revert to their natural influences; in
Ireland, I think the Government will / suffer greatly, as much as will compensate the
Tories for their loss in the English Counties.‘

So much for Politics - in wh:, at present, I am obliged to live. You exist, I /
hope, among books & flowers, & music. I hope you are well & happy, & that we
may soon meet & talk over all that has happened, since we were last together.

The / County Election will be, I think, Tuesday week. I hope you got my
address.

Ever yours, | D.”

2 The opposition in the August 1847 election (see IV 1588n1) and the March 1852 election (see VI 2250n1)
was minimal, but D’s claim is correct.

3 Sir John Yarde Buller and Lawrence Palk (both Conservative, although Palk had supported Palmerston
on 3 March and Buller had been absent) would be returned unopposed for S Devon on 30 March. On
6 April at N Devon, where the incumbent Conservatives had both resigned, James W. Buller (a Liberal
requisitioned late to prevent a Conservative sweep and pledging to support Palmerston) would head the
poll and Charles H.R. Trefusis (Liberal-Conservative, nephew of Lady Rolle) would narrowly defeat Sir
Stafford Northcote (Liberal-Conservative) for the second seat. The Times (19, 21 Mar 1857). See
2929&n6.

4 A total of 654 (243 county and 411 borough) members were elected in the 1857 general election; the
Liberals gained 50 seats in England, 3 in Wales, 5 in Scotland, and lost 8 in Ireland, for a majority of
g2 (minority of 8 in 1852). BHF 139-40. The Times on 8 April tallied that, in England, Wales and Scotland
up to that date, the Liberals had gained 28 counties and lost only one, for a net gain of 27 counties.
On 30 April it calculated that 170 members in the new parliament had not been in the previous one.
For the Conservative party’s own figures (showing for one thing a net loss of 23 county seats) and an
analysis of the 1857 results see Stewart Conservative Party 329-46. See further 2928&nn5&7 and 2936&n1.

5 SBW on 29 March thanked D for his letter and his ‘eloquent convincing address’, which she had read
in the Press (see 2916&ph): ‘My chief amusement is cultivating roses, and my best companions are of
the silent order ...’ RTC [303Q].

A great many polls, but so early, that one cannot depend on the final result.

—_—

Nominations were held in 167 constituencies on 27 March. MP (27 Mar 1857). At the poll at Leeds on
28 March, Robert Hall (1801-1857), a barrister (Lincoln’s Inn 1828), recorder of Doncaster 1845, would
win the seat he had unsuccessfully contested in 1852; the other seat would be won by a Liberal, who
headed the poll. Hall would live only until 26 May and be replaced by another Conservative on 5 June.
At Portsmouth, which the Conservatives had not contested since 1837, Sir James Dalrymple Horn
Elphinstone (1805-1886), 2nd Bt, would head the poll on 30 March and sit as Liberal-Conservative MP
1857-65, 1868-80, lord of the treasury 1874-80.

At Carlisle on this day (27 March), the poll was headed by William Nicholson Hodgson (1807-1876),
Conservative MP for Carlisle 1847-52, 1857-9, 1865-8, for E Cumberland 1868-76. Sir James Graham, who
had headed the poll in 1852 when both seats were won by Liberals and Hodgson was defeated, was also
elected. McCalmont.

3 Lady Graham had been ill and would live only until 25 October; confusion may have arisen from the
announcement on 27 March of the death on 24 March of Lady Caroline Graham, an elder sister of 4th
Duke of Montrose. MP (27 Mar 1857); Arvel B. Erickson The Public Career of Sir James Graham (1952) 380.

On this day (27 March), Sir Walter Minto Townshend Farquhar (1809-1866), 2nd Bt, was returned for
Hertford (although not finally at the head of the poll), where both seats had been held by Liberals; he
would be Independent Conservative MP for that borough until his death. William Vansittart (1813-1878)
was returned at the head of the poll for Windsor, where also both seats had been previously held by
Liberals: he would be Liberal Conservative Mp for Windsor 1857-65.

EDITORIAL COMMENT: MA’s account entries for 30 March read: ‘Monday Railroad to Aylesbury & 2
seats back. 2/6’; and: “We left G Gate at 2 for Aylesbury to attend the nomination.’ H acc. The Ds were
both present for the proceedings that began at 10 am on Tuesday 31 March. BH (4 Apr 1857). MA’s entry
for 6 April reads: ‘Monday we left G Gate for Hughenden. Dizzy to the Quarter Sessions first’. Hence
it seems unlikely that the Ds went to Hughenden on 31 March after the election, although of course D
would use that as his address for this letter.

The polls mentioned are for contested ridings all of which had held nominations on 27 March and held
polls the next (this) day and/or Monday 30 March. For Leeds see 2919&n1. At Norwich, Sir Samuel
Bignold (1791-1875), mayor of Norwich 1833, 1848, 1853, 1872, Conservative MP for Norwich since 1854,
would be defeated by a Liberal on 30 March. At Liverpool, where the Conservatives had been reduced
to one seat in 1855, Thomas Berry Horsfall (1805-1878), mayor of Liverpool 1847-8, Conservative MP for
Derby 1852-3, for Liverpool 1853-68, would retain his seat on the goth; a noon Saturday result showed
the other Conservative (Lib-Cons) candidate trailing. A 10:45 am Saturday tally showed John Chevallier
Cobbold (1797-1882), chairman of the Eastern Union and of the Ipswich and Bury St Edmund's
Railways, Conservative MP for Ipswich 1847-68, and Henry John Selwin, a first-time Conservative candidate, leading the poll at Ipswich. Cobbold maintained his lead, but Selwin lost to a Liberal on the 28th.
Selwin, who would take the additional surname of Ibbetson in 1867 and succeed his father as 7th Bt in
1869, would be Conservative MP for S Essex 1865-8, for W Essex 1868-85, for Epping 1885-92, undersecretary to the home department 1874-8, secretary to the treasury 1878-80. G.M.W. Peacocke lost his
seat at Maldon to a Liberal on the 28th. Charles John Chetwynd Talbot (1830-1877), Viscount Ingestre,
who in 1868 would succeed as 19th Earl of Shrewsbury and 4th Earl Talbot, Conservative MP for Stafford
1857-9, for Staffordshire N 1859-65, for Stamford 1868, on the 28th won one of the two seats previously
held by Liberals at Stafford, easily defeating Frederick William Cadogan (1821-1904), youngest son of
3rd Earl Cadogan, a barrister (Inner Temple 1847), Liberal MP for Cricklade 1868-74. Also on the 28th,
the Liberals took both seats at Shrewsbury, taking one away from the Conservatives. At Maidstone on
the goth, both seats would be won from the Liberals by Conservatives. At Dover on the 28th, Liberals
won both seats, one of which had been held by a Conservative; a 10:45 am Saturday report showed the
Liberals holding substantial leads. MP (27, 28 Mar 1857).

Grosvenor Gate, April 3rd, 1857.
I have been much on the Continent during the last year, and have found great and
frequent complaints of the omission of many of my works in the reprints which you
have published of those productions. I have often intended to write to you on the
subject, but the great pressure of affairs has always prevented me ... Probably the
fault is mine, as I ought, perhaps, to have furnished you, as heretofore, with
corrected copies, but the Revolution of 1848 seemed to terminate these literary
speculations and since then I have always been too busy ... The works omitted are
some of those most eagerly sought at home ...'

At Aylesbury on 31 March after the nomination of the incumbents for the three seats (D had been
nominated by Col Hanmer and seconded by John Newman), the three candidates had been declared
elected by acclamation. BH (4 Apr 1857).

Tauchnitz wrote more than a year later, on 12 August 1858, referring to this letter. He was confused by
‘the interference of a third person,’ William Lovell, who had written to him twice about the republication of some of D’s books; he offered to republish Venetia (for his purchase of the continental rights to
it in 1838 see IV 1363n1). Evidently Lovell was acting as D’s literary agent, in March 1858 reporting offers
from two publishers for the copyright of D’s works rumoured as being for sale, and that he had
threatened proceedings against Bryce, ‘who holds back from delivering the rest of the copies.’
H E/VII/J/4, R/11/B/5-6. For D’s dealings with Bryce see VI 2580n1. Tauchnitz, who had published an
edition of Tancred in 1847, would publish editions of Venetia in 1858 and of Vivian Grey and Henrietta
Temple in 1859. William B. Todd Tauchnitz International Editions in English 1841-1955: A Bibliographical

EDITORIAL COMMENT: Paper imprinted ‘Hughenden Manor’.

Private Sunday 12. Ap. 1857
Henry Padwick | Esqr
My dear Sir,
Your letter was much appreciated. I had previously seen your bulletin, posted up
in the Hall of the Carlton. I am of opinion, that we owe the / seat entirely to your
exertions & influence, & I have mentioned this in the proper quarter.'

I do not wish to conceal, that I am disappointed about your own case, but I am
resolved, that it shall be accomplished.” After tomorrow, / if you have any
cause to write, direct to me

1 Jolliffe had written on 10 April about the Speakership (see 2914). Walpole badly wanted it, but Jolliffe
had learned that Russell favoured Evelyn Denison. He enclosed letters on the subject from Isabella
Walpole (Walpole’s wife; see also app I 2774xX&n1) and Henry Drummond, and suggested D write to
Derby at Knowsley on the matter. H B/XX/J/44. See further 29348n2. Denison would be elected Speaker
on 30 April.

2 Baring had written to MA on 6 April reminding her that D had long ago promised him a visit. H D/III/
C/26. The Ds would return to Hughenden from Norman Court on 18 April. H acc.

3 T-.E. Taylor (assistant party whip) would be one of two Conservatives returned for Dublin co on 16 April.
G.A. Hamilton (the other assistant whip) on 22 April would tell D that Taylor ‘was much gratified’ by
D’s letter (not found) to him. H B/XX/H/61. Rose on 18 April would write to D: ‘All our elections
excepting Leitrim are over and I hope you are satisfied with the result. Ireland has quite answered our
expectations ...’ H R/1/B/29. See Stewart Conservative Party 340, which shows that in 1857 the Conservatives (according to their party managers) elected 260 members, gaining 5 seats in Ireland although
sustaining a net loss of 20 seats overall; Stewart comments (341): ‘the losses of 1857 cut most deeply into
the fringe of the party.’ Cf2918&n4 and 2928&n5.

Padwick’s letter has not been found; presumably he had been active in the election at Horsham (his
home constituency), in which W.R.S. Fitzgerald (Lib-Cons) on 28 March had defeated the Liberal
candidate 173-117.

2 Padwick may have tried to be made a magistrate; see 3242. Alternatively, he may have tried to find a
constituency in which to stand for election; he would be an unsuccessful candidate in 1859.

April 13 1857.
My dear Sa,
I am happy to hear of what has happened to you, tho’ I think you deserved much
more ~ however, it is well.’
What tidings of your invalid? about whom I am very anxious.”

3 The notorious Mrs Edmonds (for whom see IV 1309n2) was evidently one of Francis Villiers’s creditors;
see VI 2840n1 and 2851n1. Lady Jersey in October 1862 would ask D what she is to do with the papers
involving her, on 23 October asking ‘Shall I burn all letters of 1855 — Mrs. Edmunds [sic] included ...[?]’
H A/IV/J/225, 227. Lord Villiers’s letter has not been found.

1 Lennox, who had been returned unopposed for one of the two seats at Chichester on 27 March, had
written on ‘Sunday’ (postmarked 5 April 1857 at Chichester): *... | cannot resist writing one line, just
now, when matters appear to be going so very badly; to renew the expression of my hommage [sc] to
you & your service & my ardent hopes that something more cheery may turn up ... What a perfect
Inkermann has the Dissolution proved ...’ He reported that his father hoped that D and Derby would
counter any government reform proposal ‘with a rattler, £5 instead of £10 in Counties.’ H B/XX/LX/89.
Evidently in his response D told of his round of county visits before the session resumed on 30 April.

1 Sarah had written to MA from St Leonards on g April of the death on ‘Tuesday’ of her ‘kind & faithful
friend’ Mrs Meredith. On 10 April (‘Good Friday’) she wrote of having just learned that Mrs Meredith
had left her £2,000: ‘I know it will please Dis ... - the magnitude of the amount quite surprises me ...’
H D/lW/A/417-18. Mrs Meredith’s son William, who died in 1831, had been Sarah’s fiancé.

2 See 2899&n1 and 2914&n1. On 23 March Sarah had written to MA: “The Doctor here who is reckoned
very skilful assures us our patient is stronger, but she varies so much that I never know what to say ...’
On 21 April she would write again: *... these two days my charge has been out in an open carriage, & if
the cough be not increased by it, I shall believe that at last she has made an advance ... Isabella desires
me to offer her kind regards with love to Dis .... On 24 April she would report that Isabella had that day
given birth to a daughter, two months prematurely: *... the doctor assures us she is doing perfectly well
- the child is naturally a poor thing ... A telegraphed message had brought James and a nurse by
1 o'clock ‘- a great relief to me .... On the 27th she reported that Isabella was doing well, although the
baby had not lived long. Sarah would regularly send mostly favourable reports from St Leonards, until
17 June, when it was evident Isabella was dying. On 20 June she would inform the Ds that Isabella had
died that morning. H D/Hi/A/416, 419-28. See further 2943&n1.

We go tomorrow to Norman Court on a visit to Tom Baring. I / cd. not stand
the agitation of changing my line four times across country, wh: you do so coolly,
& therefore we go via Paddington, & shall just get in time for Waterloo Bridge.”

In another week we have to pay some county visits in the north: the Pauncefort
Duncombes, Hanmers, Chester &c., the result of the general Election.*

I am not at all dissatisfied with the new Parliamt. The total destruction / of
sections, & of conceited individuals, will render the state of the New Ho: of Commons much more wholesome, & tho’ nominally the Conservative party may be a
little lessened, still whenever a due occasion offers, I think we shall bring a greater
force into the field than heretofore. In the last Parlt., we had 280 on our muster
roll, but when the hour of battle arrived, cd. never count on more than 220; the
rest away, or / against us — now, Jolliffe tells me, I have 260 true men, fresh & not
jaded with the mortifying traditions of the Jast parliament.

I don’t think Palmn’s name really carried a single vote. In the Boro’s for a Tory
oppos[iti]on, we were really successful in many great seats, & only lost four on the
whole. As for the Counties, Protection being dead, they returned to their natural
influences as was always foreseen. In Ireland, the Govt. was positively unpopular.”

It is a great thing also, irrespective of the Peelites, to have got rid of Deedes &
Co.® — & in little matters, Sampson <7 W.W. the latter the most offensively conceited
fellow, that ever obtruded himself.’

Yours affly | D.

3 See 2914n1 and 2925&n2. The Ds on 14 April would take the Great Western Railway from Wycombe to
Paddington, then a four-shilling cab ride to Waterloo, and there the South Western Railway to Winchester, 8% miles from Stockbridge. H acc.

The Ds would visit the Pauncefort Duncombes 21-25 April, returning to Hughenden. H acc. Philip

Duncombe Pauncefort Duncombe (1818-1890), 1st Bt (1859), of Great Brickhill Manor, Bucks, JP and

DL, in 1844 had married Sophia Caroline Maunsell (d 1889), youngest daughter of Col Thomas Philip

Maunsell Mp, of Thorpe Malsor, Northants. Col Hanmer on 20 April would repeat his invitation of

23 March to visit his wife and him at Stockgrove, suggesting the end of the following week (2-3 May).

H B/XXI/H/ 135-6. The visit to the Chesters would be postponed; see further 2938&n1.

See 2918&n4 and 29258&n3; see also the analysis in Robert Blake The Conservative Party from Peel to

Churchill (1970) 46. On 4 April, the Press had crowed that ‘the Peelites are completely extinguished ...

[and] the rout of the [Anti-Corn Law] League party and of the Administrative Reformers has not been

less signal ...’ It argued that parliament was now polarized between Conservatives and Radicals, with the

former probably in the majority. For an analysis of the Peelite decline from 89 in 1847 to 26 in 1857

(the last election in which they would be a distinct group), see Robert Blake op cit 96. D’s analysis of the

election would be repeated in the Press’s lead article on 18 April, when Northants § and Norfolk E would

be cited as examples of counties in which, ‘when there is no stirring political question before the public
mind, ... traditional names and territorial influences must command success.’

6 Wm Deedes, an ultra-Protestant, had been defeated at E Kent, but would be re-elected there in December.
In his 5 April letter (see 2927n1), Lennox had listed Deedes with Lord Wm Cholmondeley (retired,
Hampshire $), Lord George Manners (defeated at Cambridgeshire) and Sir Wm Bowyer-Smijth (defeated
at Essex S) as losses he would not regret.

7 There was no MP named ‘Sampson’ in D’s time; the reference may be to Samson Ricardo (1792-1862),
brother of David Ricardo, who on 27 March 1857 had been defeated at Windsor, where he had been
first elected Liberal MP in 1855. The only ‘W.W.’ to suffer defeat in 1857 was William Wells (1818-1889),
grandson of 1st Earl of Carysport and son-in-law of 8th Earl of Wemyss, 1st Life Guards 1839-43, JP and
DL for Kent and Huntingdonshire, Liberal MP for Beverley 1852-7, for Peterborough 1868-74. Ricardo
never spoke in the House, and Wells up to this time had spoken only once.

ORIGINAL: RTC [64]
PUBLICATION HISTORY: M&B Iv 76, dated at Hughenden 13 April 1857; Blake 375, extract dated
13 April [1857]
EDITORIAL COMMENT: Paper imprinted ‘Hughenden Manor’. There is no salutation. Sic: Lipscombe.
April 13. 1857
I thought you might like to have a little line from Hughenden Manor, after all this
tumult, from wh: we are just recovering.

{ am, by no means, dissatisfied / by the results of the general Election, strange
& startling as they have been. They realize what I foretold: we shall, now, have a
House of Commons with two parties & with definite opinions. All the sections, /
all the conceited individuals, who were, what they styled themselves, “independent,”
have been swept away, erased, obliterated, expunged. The state of affairs wh: will
be / much more wholesome, & more agreeable.

The Conservative party have got thro’ the ordeal very well. Tho’ numerically a
little lessened, they are much more compact & united, & even as regards numbers,
when a due occasion offers, will bring a / larger force into the field, than in the
last Parliament. Altho’ we had then 280 & more on the muster roll, still when the
hour of battle arrived, we never cd. count on more than 220, the rest absent, or
worse, against us. Now we have, / I am assured by Sir William Jolliffe, the Chief of
my staff, 260 good men & true, fresh & not jaded by the mortifying traditions of
the last Parliament.

Enough of all this. How are you, & your sweet & silent companions, roses & /
violets?' We were nearly paying you a visit, but must postpone it for a while, to go
thro’ a series of County visits wh: are the inevitable consequence of a general
Election, & being returned Knight of the Shire.

Tomorrow we go to Norman Court, / Mr Thomas Baring’s, for two or three days,
long promised, & then to the North of this County, to the Pauncefort Duncombes
of Brickhill Manor, who proposed me in 1847,” & then to Colonel Hanmer of
Stockgrove Park, who proposed me in 1857 — then to the Chesters of Chicheley, &
to the Lovetts / of Lipscombe,” & the Dayrells of Lillingstone Dayrell,* & a great
many more, all of whom, by their ancestors, came in with the Conqueror, tho’
Colonel Hanmer had an ancestor, or something like one, I find much more
interesting, for / he married a Miss Ximenes, a descendant of Cardinal X, & yet
a daughter of Israel notwithstanding, so I think he must have been quite gratified
proposing me as member for Bucks.”

1 See 2918n5.

2 In 1847 D's proposer had been Philip Dauncey; see Iv 1577n3. Pauncefort Duncombe had proposed him
in 1852; see Vi 2250n1.

3 Phillips Cosby Lovett (1821-1891), who inherited the Liscombe estate in Bucks in 1856, JP, DL, high
sheriff 1863, at one time captain of the Royal Bucks Yeomanry, in 1846 had married Catherine Smithwick, daughter of Peter Smithwick, of Barranlough, co Tipperary. D’s spelling of the estate’s name may
be explained by the fact that ‘there is a plate of Liscombe House in Lipscomb’s History of Buckinghamshire.’ Sheahan 750.

4 E.F. Dayrell (see IV 1557n1) in 1823 had married Letitia Jane Lyster, daughter of William Lyster, of
Belmont, co Wexford.

Bear Place, Berks, sheriff of Berks. Francisco Jimenes (or Ximenes) de Cisneros (1436-1517) was created
cardinal in 1507 and appointed regent of Spain in 1516. Dod’s Peerage ... (1842) in its entry for Sir David
Ximenes KCH, of Bear Ash, Berks, states: ‘the family is descended from Jean Ximenes (bro. of Cardinal
Ximenes, regent of Spain), and settled in England about 100 years ago.’

TJ. Ouseley, one of D’s staunch press supporters at Shrewsbury (see IV 1$72n1), had written on
19 January 1856 from the ‘“Herald” Office, 12 Parker St, Liverpool’: ‘I forward you by this post a New
Paper I have started in this great maritime town. You will find your name mentioned in two of the
leading articles ... 1 hope if the paper prospers to do some good service to the great National Cause you

place of the ill Coulton (who would live only a few more weeks) for advice on the line to be pursued
in the Press on the resumption of the session, would mention some of the assaults on D and the
Conservatives: ‘The political article in the Edin: Review looks like the composition of Mr. [Robert] Lowe
[confirmed by Wellesley Index I 506 #2344]. The Times of today reprints an extremely gross passage from
the intensely personal Punch, and I have little doubt, but that the Liberals will use up the press in all
directions against the Conservative Party. Their cry will be “We have the country with us — look to our
majority — trust the public press &c.”’ H B/V1I/255.

My dear Lord,

I found my papers, here, about the New Reform Bill talked of in 1853,’ & they
give rise, at this moment, to very grave considerations.

I am not sure.
Eng: Counties return MPs to Population

Counties — 144 8,777.210 = 1 .. 60,869

William Wentworth Fitzwilliam Hume (1805-1892), who assumed the surname Dick instead of Hume in
1864, of Humewood, co Wicklow, JP and DL for Wicklow, high sheriff 1844, Conservative MP for co
Wicklow 1852-80, had been re-elected on 16 April. The result was included in a list of final polls from
Ireland in the Press on 18 April. At the nomination, Hume had lost the show of hands to Capt Richard
Monck (mistakenly listed in the later tally and in McCalmont as C.S. Monck), a well-connected wounded
war veteran, but had then defeated Monck at the polls 1610-1030 after Lord Milton (the Liberal MP who
headed the poll) denied that there was a coalition between himself and Monck and declared his tenants
free to vote as they pleased. The Times (4, 8, 10, 11, 16 Apr 1857). Hume was particularly ‘valuable’ to
the party as the designated heir (after his mother’s death) to the estates (valued at £2-3 million) of his
ailing uncle, Quintin Dick, who would live only until March 1858; his mother died in 1864.

I wish you wd. think over this state of things very much. As Conservatives, it was
not for us to disturb the settlement of / 1832 — but that settlement is disturbed, &,
so far as “true reformers” are concerned, is to be disturbed in a sense still more
unjust, than the existing arrangement.

I don’t think the country, dinned to death with the unjust representation of
large towns compared with small ones, has the slightest idea of the real state of
affairs: & nothing but discussion in Parliament, in an authoritative manner, can
enlighten them. /

I suggest to you, whether a juster apportionment of M.Ps may not be the question ef on wh: a powerful & enduring party may not be established: whether we
shd. not at once originate such a discussion: by a resolution something like the
following (or by other means) “That in the opinion of this House in all measures
for improving the representation of the Commons in Parliament, it is expedient
that there shd. be a juster apportionment of members / to Counties & Boros, than
at present exists”: whether a notice of “a resolution, on the subject of Parliamentary
Reform”, shd. not be given the first night of the Sess::

and that, whether the Queen’s speech refers to the subject or not:

In either case, it might convey to the Government the / spirit in wh: we wish the
Reform should take place, & prove the strength of the Conservative view on the
subject:

Also consider, whether a reform, in such a spirit, wd. not be extremely beneficial
to the Conservative party, as the present arrangement, wh: leaves the balance of
power in small Boros, wh: are ruled / by cliques of Dissenters, seems fatal to the
maintenance of the present aristocratic & ecclesiastical institutions.

If fifty members were added to the Counties, by tak reducing the small Boros to
one member —- & every ten pound householder in the County population were
annexed to a Boro constituency, you would [illegible deletion] add much to the
Constituency of the Boroughs — & / greatly increase the Conservative power at the
same time.

There are 10,000 other things to say, but I have roughly jotted down these
materials for reflection — our party is now a corpse, but # it appears to me, that,
in the present perplexed state of affairs, a conservative public pledged to parliamentary
reform, a bold & decided course, / might not only put us on our legs, but greatly
help the country & serve the state.

But I am for beginning mildly — in a conciliatory spirit - giving the governmt.
credit for justice & patriotism, & placing our case before them, that they & Parliamt may not otherwise become pledged / to a further development of the present
unjust & injurious system.

I hope you will be able to make out this conversational despatch.

Remember the great effect produced by statements wh: I made in H. of C. in 1852,

(on / Hume’s motion for Parlty reform, i.e. giving more members to great towns,
& disfranchising small ones) as to the injustice of counties like N. Lincolns[hire]
&c with 2, or 300,000 inhabitants, exclusive of represent{ativ]e town population,
having only two members when a City or Boro’, with 20, or 30,000 inhabitants, had
the same number.”

Ld. J.R., -p- when he introduced his R Bill in 1853-4° referred to this view of the

telling.’

Queen’s speech — new faces, new parties, a complete revolution of persons — & all
in less / than three months!’

Tomorrow, I go up, but only for the morning, to see the Speaker chosen.* There
are many heartburnings as to the Selection — some on my side — among the opposite, yr. old friend Henry Fitzroy.

You wou’d be amused by the visits we have been paying to some of my principal
/ supporters in the north of this county during the last few weeks: people you
never heard of before, yet living with a refinement & splendor quite remarkable.
Nothing more striking, than some of yr. English gentry with chateaux, parks, &
broad domains; greater men by a good deal, than many German Princes, & yet /
utterly unknown in London society - among these one of our greatest Bucks
Squires, a Mr. Pauncefort Duncombe, whose home was really radiant, & contrasted
very much with Woburn Abbey, wh: he took us over to see; larger, but the most
gloomy & squalid palace that you can conceive.”

One / day we went to see Mentmore, wh: one of the Rothschilds is building or
rather has built in the midst of the Vale of Aylesbury — a hunting palace, wh: will
be to this county, what Belvoir is to the vale of that name. But all that even you can
recal or fancy of interior taste, splendor, & magnificence & curiosity of art, can give
you only a faint idea of the reality of this gorgeous palace. I have / been told, for
more than fifteen years, Rothsd. has had agents in every part of Europe, regardless
of cost, collecting its contents — but the taste of their distribution is as remarkable
as their curiosity & costliness. The Hall appears to me the masterpiece of modern
art & decoration — glowing with color, lit by gorgeous venetian lamps of golden
filagree, that / once were at the head of Bucentaurs. Such chairs — Titian alone cd.
paint them — such clocks of lapis lazuli — such cabinets of all forms & colors — such
marble busts of turbaned Moors — such a staircase of polished marble from this vast
central saloon, for such it really is, glittering with its precious contents, & yet the
most / comfortable & liveable in apartment in the world.’

According to the Press (18 Apr 1857), the new parliament had 186 new members, 66 Conservatives and

120 Liberals replacing 94 and 92 respectively (cf2918n4); the swearing-in ceremonies would occupy the

House 2-6 May, and the Queen's speech would be read by the lord chancellor on 7 May, D refusing even

to have a meeting of party leaders to discuss it. Malmesbury II 69 (2 May 1857); M&B IV 82 (4 May 1857).

2 The Ds went to Grosvenor Gate on 30 April and returned to Hughenden 1-6 May. H acc. However, D
missed the unopposed selection of J.E. Denison as speaker because of Jolliffe’s mistake about the hour
(see 2934n3; members had been summoned for 2 o’clock and the business was concluded by 3 o’clock),
and it fell to Walpole, one of the disappointed aspirants for the Speakership, to explain D’s absence and
extend his party’s congratulations to Denison. Hansard CXLV cols 4-11; The Times (1 May 1857). Punch
on 9 May would facetiously remark that D had been deliberately absent to give Walpole a chance to do
‘a pleasant thing’.

party members increasingly inclined to give up on the Press and instead try to start another paper or
take over MH, in which case the ‘gentleman’ may have been G.A. Hamilton; see 2997&n2. Rose, another
possibility, on 18 April (see 2925n3) had written: ‘I am in active communication with Lord Malmesbury
as to a daily organ price 2d. which I hope will come out on the day the Queen's Speech is read. In
addition to the objects of the party which it will be designed to serve I hope to make it effectually aid
yours in regard to the financial position of the P.. On 20 October 1857 he would write: ‘I had a long
interview with Sir F. Kelly yesterday. He has not seen the P’s at present but intimates there will be no
difficulty in their doing something, whether to the extent formerly indicated or to the half only must

Powell, the main Conservative agent in Bucks, had written from Newport that local farmers would like
D and Du Pre to dine with them on a mutually convenient Wednesday, possibly 6 May. On 29 April,
Chester accordingly invited D to Chicheley for 6-7 May, but Powell, not having heard from D, also then
suggested the 13th, and, on 6 May, an ultimate date of 20 May. He thought it politic for D to stay at
Chicheley, as Chester was anxious for neighbours to meet him, ‘and his Interest is considerable in many
respects and particularly with the Church.’ On 9 May he acknowledged D’s note (not found) agreeing

reply to those Parliamentary Reformers who insist on what they call the anomalies of our representative
system.’ The Times (1 Apr, 15, 21, 22 May 1857).

2 Powell suggested D write to Chester, who felt ‘a little piqued’ at D’s delay in replying to the Chicheley
invitation. D did intend to include the Chesters among the N Bucks constituents to be visited after the
election; see 2928 and 2929.

3 On 14 May, the main items debated in the Commons, which met from 4 to 6:40 pm, were motions for
a married women’s property bill and for a bill to abolish ministers’ money in Ireland, D objecting that
the latter should be a government bill. Hansard CxLV cols 257-86 (D 281-2).

The word here rendered as ‘openly’ is badly smudged in Ms.

2 The strategy of avoiding divisions as much as possible was adopted by the Conservatives after the 1857
general election had given Palmerston a strong personal endorsement which the Conservatives hoped
would not be turned into permanent support for the Liberals; see 2932&n4 and 2934&nz2. It is possible
that the division D is here trying to avoid is the one on 19 May on the Ministers’ Money (Ireland) Bill
(see 2938n3), a private-member’s bill which Palmerston had decided to support and which the government would win 313-174 against the ultra-Protestants, Stanley voting with the government (as he had
done once before, on 23 May 1854 (Hansard CXXXIII cols 834-6; see also VI 2565n8) and D with the
minority. Hansard CXLV cols 542-621. The printed bill was issued on 16 May. MP (18 May 1857). Another
awkward issue that arose at this ime was that of a dowry and annuity for the Princess Royal. Derby’s
letter to D on 12 May seems to be about this matter; it enclosed a letter from Palmerston and Derby’s
reply to it (neither found). Derby remarked to D: ‘This latter, you will see, leaves us quite at liberty as
to our course; but I suppose that we must “combine” with the Government to protect them against their
Radical supporters.’ He asked to see D in London on the 15th. H B/XX/S/149. On 18 May, Palmerston
would inform D that he would be introducing a bill to give the Princess Royal on her upcoming
marriage an annuity of £8,000 and a dowry of £40,000. When the matter was brought before the
Commons on Friday 22 May, Roebuck objected to the annuity; D thought it not desirable (and most
ungracious) to resort to ‘the painful ceremony of dividing’ on the resolution, and urged unanimity.
Roebuck finally withdrew his hostile amendment and the resolution was agreed to without a division and
scheduled to be reported on Monday. On Monday 25 May, an amendment to reduce the annuity to
£6,000 was defeated 328-14, and the dowry of £40,000 was approved in committee of supply by 361-18.
Hansard CXLV cols 720-48 (D 743-6), 837-9. The Standard and MH were catering to party interest before
they were bought; see 2955&n2 and 2997&n2.

A memorandum drawn up by Rose on 17 November 1859 to remind D of facts that had ‘escaped [his]

recollection’ gives an account of Rose’s role as trustee of D’s Llynvi Valley Railway shares as security for

a £2,500 debt to ‘Hogg & Lindsell’ (see V 2019&nn1&2, 2096n1, 21388&n1, 2139, 2147&n1, 2150 and

2187) that had been transferred to a Mr Ringrow (?) on 17 February 1858. According to the memoran
dum, Rose was chosen as trustee because he was already the trustee of D’s shares to the value of £1,000.

H R/1/B/6z2. See also VI 2503&n1 and 251g9&n2. This letter is probably about the shares Rose is holding

in trust. Rose was planning a holiday (although on 29 August he would write to say he was interrupting

his planned continuous absence briefly in mid-September); on 5 October he would report from Park

Street that he was back from his holiday. H R/1/B/31, 41.

2 The first extant Rose letter bearing the address ‘6, Victoria Street, Westminster Abbey S.W.’ (see also
cover) is dated 2 January 1857; by 20 October the letterhead has added to it ‘NOTE CHANGE OF OFFICES’
with a hand pointing to the address. Some 1857 Rose letters are still addressed at Park Street. H
R/1/B/28, 32a. The possibility of confusion between the two addresses therefore points to 1857, a year
in which 4 June fell on a Thursday.

3 Because it is so sparse, any information about D’s financial dealings is intriguing. For example, adjacent

to this letter is a January 1856 application by D for £50,000 in an ‘Italian Five Per Cent State Domain

Loan’; according to the compteted form, D enclosed £2,500, the 5% down payment on his application,

but there is no indication the application was processed or approved. H R/I/A/129. Then there is a Rose

letter dated only ‘Saturday night’: ‘Mackenzie [presumably James Thompson Mackenzie, on the board of the

General Credit and Finance Company Ltd when it was formed by Rose’s firm in 1863} gave me two papers

relating to the Swedish loan today which I think comes out on Monday thro’ Schroeders house, but in

which I understand Mackenzie & his party share, and when he gave me the paper He said “These are
for you and your friend D and I will do something for both of you but do not mention it to anyone else”

I said is it good? He said VERY good indeed, as you will see and you may reckon upon a moderate slice.

Could you not ascertain from Rothschild, what you had better do. I dare say I can find the money for

both but J should like to feel we were on safe ground. We ought to act on Monday, and if Mackenzie

will engage that we shall have what we ask for I am for selling at once and making sure. If you hear
anything Pray let me know before Monday morning ... [P.S.] I will send you the paper to sign on

Monday morning. H R/1/B/207. The Swedish bonds were issued in late 1855. The Times (21 Nov 1855);

seems that / Sebastopol literally means “blessed city” & the received version of
Armageddon, is “accursed plain” — so they don’t exactly agree. A philosopher, who
laughs at the theological view of the question, & therefore shocks the ladies, has
however frightened them equally by his scientific announcement that the world has
already been destroyed sev 27 times, that, reasoning by analogy, it must be /
destroyed again & probably often; that he rather imagines it will not be destroyed
on the 13th. Inst, but there is no reason why it shd. not be destroyed before that,
as the destructive agencies are all rife — in the centre of the earth a raging fire,
while the misty tail of the comet wd, if it touched us, pour forth an overwhelming
deluge — so in 4 & 20 hours we may be shrivelled or drowned. In the meantime,
if the catastrophe do not occur, we hope to be at Torquay by the end of next
month.*

comet of 1556 (on the mistaken assumption that it was the same one that had appeared in 1264), first
for 1848, and then (in 1857) for about 1858. A German astrologer in an almanac had displaced the
scientific discussion and induced both panic and amusement with a prediction that the comet would
strike the earth on 13 June 1857. The Times on 23 May had reprinted an article that pooh-poohed the
current spate of end-of-the-world-by-comet predictions, and the Press on 6 June had had an advertisement for ““a pleasant satire”’ on the comet scare that quoted from a notice: ‘“Enough of the horrible
in the details to frighten female readers into hysterics.” The day would pass without comment in the
press, although on 23 June The Times would report that a comet had been briefly sighted in the late

The tragedy has / been so swift, that one can scarcely realize it, but the time will

There are two extant notes from Ralph to MA (none to D) about Isabella Disraeli’s final illness at St
Leonard’s (see 2914), one dated ‘Friday morning’ (docketed June 1857 by MA) reporting ‘that Isabella
has had a very serious attack & the doctors have taken away all hope ...’, and one dated ‘Friday night’
at Cork Street (docketed by MA as answered on 14 June): ‘All was not over when I left, & the dear
Patient has passed a day without suffering ... This morning early, they thought she was quietly passing
away, but she rallied just as suddenly as she had just previously sunk. It is a terrible shock for poor James
& tho he is aware all hope has fled, still it is impossible for him at times to believe there is not a chance.
It is a great trial too for dear Sa, she is tolerably well ...’ Sarah’s most recent extant letter to MA is dated
3 June at St Leonard's: ‘... our invalid has been out for a drive ... I hope this is an advance, but she gains
no strength ...’ On the 17th Sarah would write to MA: ‘Ralph will have told you that everything here
continues the same; but I write a few words that you may not think me forgetful of the interest you &
Dis express ... James knows I am writing & sends his love to you & Dis, as I do too.’ On the 20th she
would report that Isabella had died peacefully at four that morning, and that James was ‘quite overwhelmed’: ‘... I hope that God will support him & me too ...’ H D/II/A/426-8, B/22, 23. See further

29446n1.

See 2943n1. Sarah replied on the 23rd: “We both feel very grateful for your affectionate expressions of
sympathy. Poor dear James cannot be consoled but he is soothed by love & kindness.’ Isabella’s
immediate family (her mother, two sisters and brother-in-law Edward Miles), visiting them the last ten
days, had just left; their sympathy had ‘upheld’ James, but now he was ‘very dejected’. The funeral would
be on Friday the 26th, and they hoped to return to London the following Tuesday or Wednesday,
although James was dreading returning to the house that showed Isabella’s attention in every detail.
James wrote to MA on ‘Wednesday night’ (1 July?) from his residence in Eaton Terrace: ‘This moment
having returned from Twickenham I find yr. beautiful present; I lose not a moment, to offer to you and
Dis my warmest thanks, and to assure you any mark of sympathy from you at this moment is most
grateful. I am vexed that an engagement on urgent private affairs prevents me offering to you in person
my devotion & to Dis my affection.’ H D/III/A/429, B/56.

Confidential June 22. 1857
His Grace | The Duke of Portland

J cannot resist the conviction, that it wo[ul]d be more than ungracious on my part,
were I to permit the confidential relations, wh: have, so strangely, / subsisted
between us, to terminate in silence.!

I am aware of the personal interposition, wh: Your Grace made, on my behalf,

at the time of the catastrophe. It must have cost you great pain & solicitude, & it
merited, & obtained, my gratitude.

I am / not insensible to the forbearance, wh: I have experienced from Your
Grace during the two last #we years.

A course of kind & considerate conduct, wh: has ranged over so long a period,
whatever the motive, ought not to be disregarded by the / recipient, & J wish to
offer you my thanks, in terms, not conventional, but cordial.

Having relieved myself so far, I would hope, that yr Grace may not be offended,
if I express myself, with equal frankness, on another point.

It has been impossible for / me, from observations, that have occasionally
dropped, since the death of the late Duke, to resist the inference, that yr Grace was
of opinion, that I had taken advantage adroitly of circumstances, & dexterously
installed myself in a profitable position.

The time has come when I| can touch upon this / matter witht. embarassment.

And in the first place: I neither suggested, nor sanctioned, the original scheme,
& if it be thought, that I yielded with too great facility, it may be remembered, that
I was acting under the influence of a person, whose position, & whose character,
were alike commanding.

For the Duke of Portland’s role (behind the facade maintained by Rose) in the financing of the Hughenden purchase that allowed D to stand for election as squire of Bucks to support his increasingly prominent
position in the party, see V 17028n1, 17308nn1-3 and 2006&n3; it had originally been the plan of Portland’s brother, Lord George Bentinck, whose death would have scuttled it but for the intervention of the
Duke, at that time Lord Titchfield. Lord Henry Bentinck, the Duke’s younger brother, on 30 April 1857
had warned D that he was ‘very jealous of the course that my Brother may take with us in Re Hughenden
& as the blow may be sudden it may be as well that arrangements shd be ready for the worst. I have been
quite mistaken in my man.’ On 22 May he had written: ‘It will be necessary to get hold of the Bonds & wash
our Hands of my Brother without delay — any negotiation with him or arrangement of any kind is out of
the Question.’ In a note dated only ‘Friday’ Bentinck wrote: ‘It will be essential for us to get out of my
Brothers hands without delay — for depend upon it, that in using the dagger he will drive it to the very
haft.’ H B/XXI/B/373-4, 383. A further clue to the Duke’s motives may be found in a 4 April 1857 letter to
D from Sir James Fergusson, attributing his loss that day of the seat for Ayrshire ‘entirely [to] the loss of
the Duke of Portland’s, and Lord Bute’s interests ...’; ie, these interests were not being used as they had
been by the previous title-holders (the current Lord Bute, who had succeeded in 1848, was only ten years
old). H B/XXI/F/103. Possibly relevant is that Lord Henry in 1858 would give Drummonds a “Pacquet of
securities’ to be conveyed ‘without examination and without the cognizance of my Executors’ to D after
his (Lord Henrv’s) death (1870). H B/XX1/B/384.

With respect to the subsequent results, / the accounts of the estate have been

Grosvenor Gate | July 13. 1857
The Indian news is really alarming. Besides the telegraph in the newspapers, there are
said, undoubtedly, to be several others last night, & I am now going down to the
House to enquire of the government the real state of / affairs.’ It is the most serious

The Duke replied from Harcourt House on the 23rd: ‘I hasten to acknowledge the receipt this afternoon of your letter of yesterdays date & to express my very great regret that you should have felt it in.
the slightest degree called for or expected. I can assure you nothing has ever fallen from me to justify
the impression you refer to from “occasional observations”. It was very unfortunate that I should have
had to take any part whatever in what has passed but unavoidable & I could but endeavour to reconcile
as well as might be contending duties. The whole subject has been a most embarrassing one & I felt fm
the first it was impossible I could ever enter on it in detail personally with yourself and you will forgive
me for continuing to abstain fm doing so. I much regret the pecuniary loss you mention having
sustained but trust it has been more than counterbalanced in your mind by the high position you have
attained.’ NOT PWK 1468.

Tensions in the Bengal army brought to a head by the introduction of the Enfield rifle and the belief
that its cartridges were greased with beef and pork fat had erupted into open mutiny at Meerut, near
Delhi, on 10 May, and by the end of June it had spread to several dozen stations. The Times on 27 June
had published a telegraphic report from Alexandria dated 21 June that the mutineers had taken Delhi
and massacred the European inhabitants, and on the 29th, published reports from Calcutta, Bombay
and Meerut, and a list of the mutinous regiments at Meerut, Delhi and Barrackpore. Also on the 29th,
D in the House observed that England’s empire, which it had recently fought three wars to protect, was
now in danger from ‘internal enemies’; he asked the government’s opinion as to the causes of the
calamity, and what measures were proposed ‘to prevent the evil consequences which may be apprehended.’ Vernon Smith replied that 14,000 troops would be sent within weeks. Hansard CXLVI cols 536-45
(D 536-40). See further 2947.

The Times on this day, 13 July, published a report (received by ‘Submarine and British Telegraph’) that
the rebels had been defeated outside Delhi, and that the situation was in hand. The next day it

thing of the kind, that has yet happened, & if it had occurred, as was perhaps att
intended, during the Russian war, the consequences might have been fatal. As it is,
it is combined with a Chinese war, & perhaps still a Persian, for Orientals will / care
little for treaties, of wh: the ink is not dry, if they think we are in danger.’

We were at the Duchess of Manchesters on Friday night; a ball of very haut ton,
& Mrs. Anson was there, very gay. I talked to her a good deal, & of the opportunity, wh: was now offered to her husband, General / Anson, for showing those
abilities, wh: his friends always knew he possessed — a man of singular firmness &
intrepidity. She was of the same opinion, & evidently saw, in the future, victories
& a coronet. Alas! at that moment, her husband had been six weeks dead! Hastening from the hills to take the command of the forces / before Delhi, he was struck
by cholera, & carried off.”

Anson had been a roué in his youth, & of singular success. Then he took much
to play, & when he left England, had been long considered, the finest whist player
in Europe. When the news first arrived, about ten days ago, & some were doubting
whether / Anson had sufficient experience for the occasion; the native army in
revolt, the ancient capital of Hindostan in possession of the rebels, & the Great
Mogul declared Sovereign; I said that, for my part, I had confidence in George
Anson, because he had seen the Great Mogul so often on the ace of spades, that
he would know / to deal with him.* All the world laughed very much, & Mrs.
Anson sent off the joke to the General. Alas! Alas!

We were turning our thoughts towards Torquay, & I was beginning to wonder,
whether the baths were yet finished there’ — but I think these events, & the necessity for more money, & more taxes, / will delay the close of the Session.°

London is very gay; fétes every night, & the Court itself at many, for the Prince

published much more extensive reports that corroborated the Delhi report but included news (evidently
already rumoured) of more widespread insurrection, massacres, and killing of officers. In the House,
D asked the government, in light of these contradictory reports, to make an authentic statement of
information received. Palmerston replied that the government knew no more than the public did.
Hansard CXLNVI cols 1367-71 (D at 1367).

2 A peace treaty ending the war between England and Persia, the latter relinquishing claims on Afghanistan and the city of Herat, had been signed in Paris on 4 March 1857 and ratified in Baghdad on 2 May.
In early July, Lord Elgin had been sent to China charged with ending the war (see 29168n1) by
negotiation or force, but some of his forces were diverted by the Indian mutiny; a peace treaty would
be signed on 26 June 1858. D (n1, col 1369) had also asked whether it was true that the Shah of Persia
had accepted the allegiance of the governor of Herat in violation of the treaty recently submitted to
parliament; the reply was that official information had not yet been received. °

3 The telegraph report (n1) contained the news that General Anson, commander-in-hief in India, had
died of cholera on 27 May.

4 Bahadur Shah I! (1775-1862), the last of the line of Moghul] emperors and nominally King of Delhi, had
allowed himself, although on a British pension, to be declared sovereign of India by the mutineers; in
1859 he would be banished to Rangoon, where he died. Hibbert 91-2, 387-8. A picture of a Moghul was
used on the best-quality playing cards, called ‘Moguls’.

5 In a postscript to her 17 July reply SBW would write: ‘I have just seen the new bath house, it is almost
finished, except for warm bathing I much prefer the bathing machine in the open sea canopied by the
Heavens and a splendid Sun what can be more beautiful and tempting.’ RTC [307Q].

6 Although parliament was not prorogued until 28 August, the only additional supply debates for military
purposes occurred briefly on 20 and 23 July and 10 and 11 August. Hansard CXLVii cols 28-49, 297-304,

the French emperor and tried to influence him on behalf of Italian nationalism at the instigation of
Cavour, her cousin. A notice in MP on 8 July read: ‘The Count and Countess Castiglione will arrive early

Carlton | July 31. 1857
Dearest Lady,
I called upon you the day you had left Holdernesse, & have been wishing to write
to you every day since - but the absorbing life / I have led of late, leaves me only
moments of action or meditation, & all the gentler duties of life seem too delicate
to be fulfilled.

But the 8th. of August is at hand, & as / you were so kind as to permit me to
arrange my course according to circumstances, I have delayed saying, what, during
the last three or four days, seemed growing inevitable, how much I regret that I /
cannot find myself under yr roof on that occasion.’

I have many things I cd. say, if we were in yr boudoir, but India is a whirl-pool
in wh: all merges — great or small. The season is / over, but the Parlt will last a
long time. Everybody is alarmed, & shocked at the private tone of the government
wh: is flippant. Her Majesty sorely oppressed, & believes like her Grandmother, she
is destined to lose provinces.”

The / Queen of Holland has been the heroine of the last fortnight — indefatigably intelligent - and the féte champetre at Orleans House the most considerable
social incident since yr departure. So much Royalty, that our friend, Lady Jersey,
seemed / to me rushing about the gardens in perplexed ecstasy.”

The Princesses in fantastic hats, sate under the trees to receive their guests; & never
was a prettier Court circle — the tables for the banquet ~ a variety of round tables —
were laid in a / bosquet, surrounded with tall green trees, & as the day was burning,
the site was delicious. Everything was well done, & the whole thing successful.

The Comte de Paris, & the Duc d’Aumale came to me after my Indian speech, wh:
they heard on Monday,’ & dined at Bellamys!’ / What do you think of that? Do

Lady Londonderry on Saturday 8 August at Seaham would give a dinner to about 3,000 of her colliery
workers, a repetition of what she had first done a year ago; see VI 2830&n1 and, in this volume,
29528n1.

2 George IIf in 1761 had married Charlotte Sophia (1744-1818), youngest daughter of Charles Louis
Frederick, reigning Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and younger sister of Adolph Frederick Iv, Duke of
Mecklenburg-Strelitz; she was queen at the time of the American Revolution.

3 Queen Sophie Frederica Matilda (1818-1877), second daughter of William 1, King of Warttemberg, had
married King William 11 of the Netherlands in 1839; she had arrived in England on 14 July, travelling
as comtesse de Buren (ie, not on a state visit). The Times (15 Jul 1857). On 22 July, as part of her heavy
social schedule, she was the guest of honour at a féte champétre hosted by the duc and duchesse d’Aumiale
at Orleans House, their villa at Twickenham. Among the numerous guests, in addition to Lady Jersey
and the Ds, were several members of the ex-royal family of France and other royalty. MP (23 Jul 1857).

4 On Monday 27 July, D in the House had moved for the production of papers, including the report to

Wellington on the organization of the Bengal army by Lt-Gen Sir Charles Napier. In his three-hour

speech he chided the government for their slight interest in what might be a mere mutiny, but which

he believed was a national revolt. He blamed the situation on the new policy (since 1848) of destroying
rather than retaining Indian nationality; he cited two recent Acts that contravened ancient practices,
allowing converts to keep inheritances and allowing Hindu widows to remarry. The crowning offence,

Sir,

I duly received yr letters.’

The despatch, wh: I wish to obtain, is one addressed by Sir Charles to the D. of
Wellington on the / organisation of the Indian Army, & not the despatch, on the
Defences of India, to wh: yr. communications refer.

You will observe, by turning to the proceedings of last night in the H: of /
Commons, that its existence is no longer denied, & that it is to be produced.”

he said, had been the annexation of Oude, leading the sepoys who had thereby been deprived of their
rights and privileges to look for an opportunity to revolt, finding occasion when English troops departed
for Persia and China, and a pretext in the greased-cartridge issue. He concluded at 8 o’clock by calling
for a royal commission on native grievances and a royal proclamation that Indian laws, customs and
especially religion would be respected. Later in an acrimonious debate in which a motion to adjourn
was defeated, D responded harshly to the charge that he took an interest in India only during troubled
times for political purposes. The motion was defeated without a division. Hansard CXLVII cols 440-546
(D 440-81, 489, 534-41, 545). Col W.H.L. Frith (unsuccessful Liberal candidate at Carrickfergus in 1852)
in a letter to D of 20 July in connection with D’s upcoming speech had argued, citing the military
experience in India of members of his family and others, that the mutiny was caused by the annexation
of Oude, not the greased cartridges. H B/XXI/F/337.

5 Bellamy’s, a chop house instituted near the Houses of Parliament by John Bellamy after his appointment
as deputy housekeeper in 1773, was virtually the dining-room and club for MPs. The name survived the
rebuilding of parliament after the 1834 fire. Patrick Cormack Westminster: Palace and Parliament (1981)
145-7. See also Coningsby Vu ch 3.

6 On this night, 31 July, Pakington would move that Napier’s report (n4) be tabled; D did not speak
during the brief discussion that touched on the issues of converts and widows, after which the motion
passed. Hansard CXLVU cols 815-25. Sir Charles James Napier (1782-1853) was the conqueror of Sind, KCB
1838, given a command in India 1841, commander-in-chief in Sind 1842-7, in India 1849-50; his Defects,
Civil and Military, of the Indian Government had been published posthumously in 1853 by his brother
William, and Records of the Indian Command of General Sir C.J. Napier ..., by ]. Mawson, had been published
in Calcutta in 1854. See further 2949&nn1&2.

Sir William Francis Patrick Napier (1785-1860), Peninsular War veteran and historian, lieut-governor of
Guernsey 1842-7, KCB 1848, lt-general 1851, general 1859, in 1844-6 had published a defence of his
brother Charles’s conquest of Sind, in 1851 a history of the administration of Sind, in 1853 his late
brother's Defects ... of the Indian Government, and in 1857 a life of his brother. He had written to D on 28
July from Sind House in Clapham about the ‘absurdity’ of the government’s refusing D a copy of Sir
Charles’s report (see 2948&n4), as he (Sir William) had published most of it three years ago in ‘“Jndian
Misgoumt”’. On § August, he had written to ask if D had received his previous letter. H B/XXI/N/15-16.
2 See 2948&n6. Napier replied on 5 August; he now knew which ‘memoir’ D desired, and offered
‘corrections’ if the government gave D ‘a garbled & foul copy such as they have done in the return to
your former motion ...’ He also apologized for ‘seeming pomposity’ about his correct military title in

his earlier letters; this was because of postal confusion with two other William Napiers. On 10 August
he would write: ‘I have got the return containing extracts from Sir C Napiers letter 15th June 1852. The
refusal to give what relates to the British troops is easily understood. He praises the Duke’s system ...
but he exposes the Indian misgovernment, the system by which the troops were Maltreated ...’ He then
made some corrections to and provided extracts omitted from the return, and assured D that Sir
Charles’s correspondence amply supported D’s contention in the House ‘that it was misgovernt that had
caused the present awful troubles.’ H B/XXI/N/17-18.

Russell on 3 August as part of his perennial attempts to get Jews admitted to the House and prior to
proceeding with his Oaths Validity Act amendment bill (introduced 21 July) had moved for a committee
predominantly of members learned in the law to consider whether the terms of the Acts that reduced
the requirements for oaths and affirmations in certain departments of state, and at Oxford and
Cambridge, could be extended to include parliament as Russell’s bill proposed. The committee of 25
‘and all gentlemen of the Long Robe, Members of this House’ (ie in the legal or clerical professions)
included D, Russell, Stanley, Pakington and Sir Richard Bethell, the attorney-general. D’s note (docketed
‘Dis’ by MA), evidently written during the committee deliberations, was answered by Russell at the
bottom of the same sheet (docketed by MA: ‘answered by Lord John Russell’); several more sheets have
comments by Pakington and Stanley similarly docketed by MA. Russell wrote: ‘I think the Attorney spoke
very well, but the current of ordinary decisions is against us.’ H B/II/Q4a-c. Stanley on 10 August
described the committee in his journal and concluded: ‘We divided 16-13, 29 being present: deciding
that the H.C. was not included ...” DBP Box 46/2. This was the result reported to the House on 10
August, whereupon Russell abandoned his bill. Hansard CXLVII cols 135-47, 933-40, 1287-8.

1 For the attempt being made to buy the Press, which D was sull guiding, see 29558nn2-4 and 29758n6.
On 8 August, under the heading ‘Lord Palmerston And The Principalities’, it had published correspondence supporting its allegation that Palmerston and his government were paradoxically (given the
Liberal tradition on nationalism) fully supporting Turkey and especially Austria in their intrigues to
prevent self-government by the united Danubian principalities as allowed by the Treaty of Paris. Since
early in the session, D had been corresponding with Earle on topics including the principalities issue,
and Earle from Paris sent D information and strategy recommendations; in an undated report evidently
early in the current session he had written: ‘To retain the friendship of France the Ministers sacrificed
their convictions on the great question of Peace or War. But they allowed that friendship to be impaired
by differences about Bolgrad & Serpent's Island.’ Earle suggested D should try ‘to secure the assistance
or at least the silence of the French Govt. With this object in view, you may perhaps see fit to accredit
our common friend [| Lennox?] as your Plenipotentiary at Paris. A short visit wd. suffice & he might turn

2952 To: LADY LONDONDERRY Grosvenor Gate [Thursday] 13 August 1857

ORIGINAL: DUR D/LO/C 530 [114]
EDITORIAL COMMENT: Black-edged paper. There is no salutation.

Grosvenor Gate | Aug. 13. 1857

I hear great, & sound praises, of yr address — from many quarters, & not merely

social ones; yesterday in the City. It seems to have been a very impressive / &
successful assembly. '

The India news arrived last evening, but the telegraph gives no new features.

After all, it is only ten days Jater than our last report.* Would you have / the

it to account to explain other things & to keep up the link.’ On 1 June Earle had reported that the
Emperor was strongly supportive of union of the principalities. H B/XX/E/17, 25.

2 Prince Frederick, further to his and D’s ‘conversation on the subject the evening before last’, on
11 August would send D a quotation from a letter dated 23 July 1857 at Bucharest: ““The Russians
have thrown off the mask and have shown themselves as strong partisans of Union as the Frensh [sic].”’
H B/XXI/H/631.

3 The French Emperor and Empress paid the Queen a closely guarded visit at Osborne 6-10 August to
discuss with her ministers some problems in Anglo-French relations, especially about the Danubian
principalities; the Walewskis were among the French entourage. With respect to Bolgrad (the Russians
having discovered there were two places with that name), the reconvened Congress of Paris had taken
the more southerly Bolgrad claimed by Russia and given it to Moldavia; Mp (1 Dec 1856) had explained
what was at issue: *... the Plenipotentiaries know quite well that when they said and wrote Bolgrad, they
meant the Bolgrad of the maps which would run the Russian boundary away from the Danube, and not
New Bolgrad, which would seat the Russians in the very position the Treaty [of Paris] was framed to
exclude them from.’ See Winfried Baumgart (Ann Pottinger Saab trans) The Peace of Paris 1856 (Santa
Barbara & Oxford 1981) 195-6. On 26 October Earle, as he had before, would recommend pressing
Palmerston on the principalities issue, so that ‘we might see him again in collision with the liberal party
... What is necessary to this object is to restore the courage of this fickle, wavering Government. At
Osborne they seem to have come to the agreement that the English Govt. should leave to France the
apparent triumph but that the question, in its important features, shd. ultimately be settled according
to the wishes of England ..." H B/XX/E/20. The ‘triumph’ of the unification of the principalities as
Romania would be announced in September, but on terms that made it very unstable.

1 See 2948&n1. Lady Londonderry’s address to her colliers, after stressing safe practices in the pits, had
developed her policy on the schools and teachers she was providing; ‘before allowing any boy to go
down to work, I shall require that they have a certain amount of education, that they should be able
to read and write ...’ She also hoped to add a requirement of religious education in any of the Christian
churches, and would promote further education for the colliers by providing night schools or time off.
She would also establish a ““Pitman’s Home” for aged colliers. She concluded: ‘Surrounded by the
sturdy producers of coal on my estate, I feel that you enable me to contribute my share in the development of the commercial interests of the country, and in return I wish to devote a woman’s head and
a woman’s heart, however feeble they may be, to the care of your interests, praying ever that God may
assist and guide me in my endeavours. (Loud cheers.)’ MP (11 Aug 1857).

2 The Times on this day published a report received by ‘submarine and British telegraph’ from India; the
previous such report had been published on 29 July. The earlier report was unclear about whether Delhi
had been recaptured, while the second stated that, as of 27 June, it had not fallen and that the first
reinforcements had arrived, from China. Both reports were otherwise mixtures of failures and successes
by the rebels.

The | Earl of Stanhope Grosvenor Gate | Aug: 13. 1857
My dear Lord,
We had a narrow escape. I came into the House in the middle of the discussion, not
being aware of the vote coming on. I found the Committee very / wicked, & intent
on mischief, wh: they proved later in the evening by putting an end to the French
Chapel, & making the government withdraw other feund votes. I found the chief of
my staff, Jolliffe, had already declared against us, & all the pack fullmouthed.

I, / therefore, did what I cd. to save the game, but am conscious I did it very
badly, as I had no case prepared, & I doubt not we might have made a good one.!

We must be on the alert next year, as there are breaker’s a-head, / 8& we must
be satisfied, at present, that we have escaped shipwreck.”

I hope Lady Stanhope is quite well.

Ever yrs sincerely, | D.

3 The celebrated soldier Sir George de Lacy Evans in 1854 had been invalided home from the Crimea,
where he had served with great distinction; on Tuesday 11 August he had addressed the House on its
failure to appreciate the significance of the Indian mutiny, and analysed the measures that had already
been implemented as the basis for detailed advice on more effective government action. Palmerston
replied with deference and respect, but thought Evans had overestimated the effect of the mutiny on
Europe; D supported Evans’s analysis, and repeated some of the charges from his previous India speech.
Hansard CXLVi cols 1392-1447 (D 1426-39, 1446, 1447). India would not again be discussed in the
Commons before prorogation.

4 The Ds would not leave for Hughenden until 26 August. H acc.

1 The House on 10 August in committee of supply had voted a second annual instalment of £2,000
towards a national portrait gallery, a project launched by Lord Stanhope (Lord Mahon until 1855) in
1856. Jolliffe had opposed the further outlay as there were already more pictures collected than could
be exhibited. D, as a member of the commission (appointed late 1856), had defended the idea of the
gallery as having great national significance, and vindicated Stanhope's ‘profound historical knowledge’
as well as the reputation of Sir Charles Eastlake, who, as the only ‘professional trustee’ on the commission, had been attacked. The committee subsequently rejected a vote of £10,500 for an English chapel
in Paris, and caused the government to withdraw a vote of £10,000 for an industrial museum at Edinburgh (D arguing that it might be deserving of support at a more opportune time); other votes were
postponed. Hansard CXLVI cols 1316-64 (D 1323-8, 1356, 1363). Stanhope, trustee of the British Museum
since 1846, had written on 12 August with profuse thanks for D’s help in the debate on ‘our Portrait
Gallery ... The obliging manner in which you referred to me personally gave me much gratification ...
I hope that in the course of next winter our Board of Trustees may also be indebted to you from time
to time (as they have been heretofore) for your presence & cooperation ...’ H B/XX1/S/483.

2 On 6 May 1858, Stanhope would send D a copy of the first annual report of ‘our National Portrait
Gallery’, which he thought might be advantageously included in the miscellaneous estimates that
contained the allocation voted for that year. H B/XXI/S8/484.

Confidential August 22. 1857
Sir Thos Gladstone | Bart:!

My dear Sir Thomas,

When we last met, we had some conversation about our Conservative press —
lamenting its inefficient & spiritless condition. Since then, a mysterious body of
Capitalists have been buying up, systematically, almost all the / Tory papers — but
their efforts are more remarkable, I think, for their command of money, than of
talent, as I see little difference in the result, altho’ they have, not however without
great distrust on my side, in some degree, from their position, connected themselves with persons of authority in our party.’

I have just learned, that / they are now in negotiation to purchase the “Press”
newspaper. This I greatly deprecate. It ought to be prevented. Troublous & critical
times are at hand, & the command of such an organ as the “Press”, now well
established, with a considerable circulation, & some intellectual repute, may be of
great moment[.]

The “Press” is at the mercy / of a mortgagee.*

1 See 2949&n1.

Sir Thomas Gladstone (1804-1889), 2nd Bt, LL and CR for Kincardineshire, Conservative MP for Queen
borough 1890-1, Portarlington 1832-4, Leicester 1835-7, Ipswich 1842, was W.E. Gladstone’s eldest

brother. In a letter to D of 24 April 1857 he had referred to an item he had seen in the Press. H B/XXI/

G/134.

2 One of the mysterious capitalists was James Johnstone; see 2997&n3. A few months earlier he had
bought MH and the Standard, immediately changing the latter to a morning paper, doubling its size to
8 pages and reducing its price to 2d; he also started the Evening Herald. On 17 June, Jolliffe in a circular
had informed the party ‘that the Morning Herald newspaper has been bought in the Conservative
interest .... H B/XX/J/46. The first issues of each paper under the new management had appeared on
29 June, Malmesbury noting in his journal that MH seemed ‘well arranged, with plenty of fashionable
news to amuse ladies.’ Robert Knox, Stanley’s friend at MH, in the spring of 1857 had proposed with
John Blackwood’s support to start three Conservative newspapers, but the project came to nothing.
Bourne Il 239-40; Koss Politecal Press 134-5; Malmesbury II 73. BHF (204-5) mentions a John Maxwell as
Johnstone’s partner in these purchases, but nothing further on him has been found.

3 Possibly Peacocke; see V1 2857&n1 and 2858&n1.

Another of my friends has agreed to do the same, & I have written to another
who has just gone abroad, who I have little doubt will also consent. But the world

embarassing to either of us.

myself in my woods; as Euripides says “the deep silence of the / mighty woods”.”

I shall write to you when we have got a little settled there & give you due notice
of our visit to Devon. I shd. think it would be about the same time as last year.

this. As he had done with Dickens, Lahure wanted the copies of D’s works to ensure that the translation
was based on editions which D approved. The short preface (which D apparently never wrote) was to
imitate an enclosed sample. H E/VII/K/ 1-2. In 1858, Lahure printed 3,000 copies of Sybil for Hachette’s
series Bibliothéque des meilleurs romans étrangers, but with no author’s introduction. In 1863, Lahure sold
this agreement to Hachette, who added a note to that effect after D’s signature. Irena Murray ‘Disraeli
Writes to Paris’ in Disraeli Newsletter I, 1 (Spring 1978) 2-4.

For the attempt to buy the Press see 2955&nn2&3; for Rose’s absence see 2940n1; for his handling of
affairs after his return see 2973&n1. Koss Political Press (135) suggests that Malmesbury’s 29 June journal
entry referring to “Mr. Hamilton, who has the management of the “Morning Herald,” is probably meant
to refer to Captain Thomas Hamber, ‘in whom Johnstone invested complete editorial control over his
multiple ventures’. But on the evidence of this letter, GA. Hamilton was probably the person meant,
as hereafter some of his letters to D show him in a managerial role; for example, on 24 September he
would write: ‘I was anxious to know from you whether you thought the time is come when it is desireable [sic] to deal with the subject of Reform in the Morning Herald ... 1 should not like any view to be
expressed in the Morning Herald which was inconsistent with your views [on the Bank Charter]’. H B/XX/

PUBLICATION HISTORY: A.B. Rathborne ed Mr. Disraeli to Colonel Rathborne (1858) 1. Many of D’s letters
in this edition are also extracted in Mr. Disraeli, Colonel Rathborne, and The Council of India. A Letter
Addressed to [Palmerston and other MPs] in Explanation of a Petition for Enquiry, presented from Colonel Rathborne,
on the gth August, 1859 (London 1860); these extracts will not be further noticed.

EDITORIAL COMMENT: The following is the text in Rathborne’s edition.

MY DEAR COLONEL. | High Wycombe, August 31st, 1857.

Sarah in an undated note had asked D’s help with the wording of Isabella Disraeli’s tombstone; she
offered two choices: ‘No. 1 In Memory of I the wife of J.D. who died at St. L. June 20 1857 in the first
year of their Marriage aged 28. No. 2. In this Grave lie interred the mortal remains of I the wife of J.D.
who died at St. L. June 1857 in the first year of their Marriage aged 28.’ She asked: ‘Will you please to
tell me if the word Marriage on the other side is English? - would not wedded life be too pedantic? &
which do you think best No. 1 or 2. — “In Memory of” is very common, almost universal, which takes off
its meaning, but perhaps the simple fact of the old-fashioned way is too homely & not reverent. | hope
these queries will not trouble you much, but I have to decide, as the words are waited for, & have no
head & no one to consult.” On 2 September Sarah would write from Eaton Terrace (James's residence,
where she had arrived the day before): ‘As soon as James is at leisure, which I hope will be the beginning of next week, we shall go to St. Leonards.’ H A/1/B/678-0.

2 A.H. Layard’s supporters at Aylesbury, where he had failed to be re-elected on 28 March, on 27 August
had given him a testimonial dinner, fully reported in The Times on 29 August. In his speech, Layard
castigated the government's handling of India along lines similar to those taken by D in the House. In
her 29 August letter from Twickenham to MA (in which her letter to D was evidently enclosed), Sarah
had remarked: ‘You will see Mr. Layard’s speech — he had not the honesty to say that Dis was the only
man in the right — people are now beginning to feel it.’ H D/IM/4/444. On Monday 31 August, The Times
had several columns on ‘The Mutinies in India’, noting that ‘a portion of the following appeared in our
second edition of Saturday’. Sarah concluded her 2 September letter thanking D for his ‘kind & speedy
response int). ‘Lavard’s speech was good — but his testimonial too absurd! a teapot & tea service!’

The Times is all for vengeance and against discussion.”

Qy. Can you have vengeance without discussion?

e.g. It seems now pretty universally agreed, that the annexation of Oude occasioned the insurrection; all its dangers and all its horrors.

Who occasioned the annexation of Oude?

In responsibility no difference can be made between Indian and English Governments. There is only one Imperial Government.

But, in this case, we need not insist upon a point, which is, however, indubitable.

During the administration of Lord Palmerston, Lord Dalhousie annexed Oude:
and when the matter was mentioned, and complained of, in the House of Commons, Mr. Vernon Smith, who had previously circulated a Blue Book to justify the
policy, declared in Parliament that it was done with the entire approbation of the
English Government, and that he was ready to defend that policy, at all times, and
against all comers.”

mentioned (see ph). For D’s account of his connection to the Press see 2975. According to a more
detailed letter, of 7 February 1860 (to be published in the next volume), and corroborated by Rathborne’s account in his 1860 Letter (see ph), D did not know Rathborne until introduced to him in 1857.
Rathborne’s Letter states that he began writing for the Press at its inception in 1853, left it in 1856
because of what he saw to be the party’s tergiversation on India, and returned to it in the spring of 1857
when, at the outbreak of the Indian mutiny, they saw their mistake. ‘Mr. Disraeli saw in this [development], no doubt, the prospect of great advantage for himself and his party, and was of course only too
glad to escape the Dalhousie and Leadenhall Street entanglement of the previous year. So he sent his
friend, Lord Henry Lennox, to arrange with the gentleman who then conducted the party paper, for
an interview with me on the ensuing Sunday [28 June?], and it took place accordingly at his house, at
Grosvenor Gate. He received me most cordially, and was profuse in his expressions of admiration for
my writings; he said he saw at once when the mutiny broke out that I was the man for the occasion: he
lamented greatly that I should have been led to discontinue my labours in the previous year; but at the
same time, he hoped that the public might not, amid other matters, have noticed this, so as to interfere
in any way with the position, which the party had now determined to take up on the subject of Indian
affairs. He expressed to me his entire agreement with me on every point advocated by me in the party
paper; and on none more decidedly than on the necessity of getting rid of the Company and its
Directors ... — he induced me to devote my whole time and talents to the party, for whom I worked
harder than any of its paid labourers; furnishing him with materials for his speeches (particularly that
of the 27th of July, 1857, which he always afterwards called “our speech,” in speaking of it to me); and
constantly seeing him, or corresponding with him, on the state of affairs in India ... until the party
attained office in February, 1858’ (pp 27-8, 67). The first extant letter from Rathborne to D is dated 16
August 1857; he returns Sir William Napier’s 10 August letter (see 2949&n2 and 2954) and offers a draft
of the query and request for papers on India that D made in the House on 17 August. H B/XXI/R/8;
Hansard CXLVI cols 1735-6. For the acrimony that developed over Rathborne’s later claim for recognition of his services, see 31928&n1, 31938&n4 and 3198&n3.

2 The Times on Saturday 29 August had called for a policy of vengeance, specifically for the utter destruction of Delhi as retaliation for what it saw to have been done deliberately ‘to degrade England, to
degrade Europe, to degrade a Christian empire and a Christian Queen.’ A second leader, reviewing the
performance of political leaders during the session just ended, had found D to be increasingly ‘pompous
and tiresome’, and lacking in patriotism and judiciousness in his attempts to turn to partisan advantage
the causes of the Indian mutiny. F.W. Haydon (now the Press editor) had written to D on 31 August:
‘I could not induce the Colonel to venture upon a hypothetical article last week. He is painfully matter
of fact, & will wait for letters & full intelligence before he writes upon the position of affairs.” H B/XXI/
H/329.

3 Dalhousie had issued the proclamation annexing the province of Oude on 13 February 1856. Vernon
Smith, president of the India board, in response to a motion for papers in the House on 4 March 1856
had said that Dalhousie had been given orders to deal with the situation in Oude as he saw fit. On 21
July when the House in committee was considering the Indian budget, he had defended the annexation,

The present ministry are virtually, not merely formally, identified with the
annexation of Oude.

They have, therefore, by their policy, caused all the dangers and disgrace which
are now on us; all the defeats, massacres, rapes, and defilements.

If vengeance is the necessity of the nation, the first examples, as they were the
prime criminals, should be Her Majesty’s present advisers. I doubt whether this
view of the case could be too strongly, or too frequently, urged.

Excuse my troubling you with this line, which you will accept in lieu of a Sunday
chat.

Yours sincerely, | D.

It might be as well to turn to Hansard of 1856, and see what was the date of the
Blue Book issued, as nothing could be said or done till that appeared. As for this
year, dissolution, &c., prevented Sir Fitzroy Kelly from bringing the motion forward.

All this in answer to V. Smith, that no one in Parliament disapproved, &c.‘

EDITORIAL COMMENT: The following is the text in Rathborne’s edition.

MY DEAR COLONEL, September 1st, 1857.
There was one point which I omitted to mention yesterday.

Assuming that the annexation of Oude was a sagacious act, it was surely a critical
experiment. Was it wise simultaneously to reduce the European forces in India, and
involve ourselves in Persian wars?!

There seems such a total absence of all statesman-like qualities in our government of India at this conjuncture!

What should produce revolt and rebellion but such courses.”

Yours, | D.

saying he took the silence in both Houses in the nearly two months since he had presented ail the
papers on the matter as evidence of general approval. Hansard CXL col 1856, CXLIII cols 1121-49. See also
2948n4.

4 On 1 September, Rathborne would thank D for a ‘note just received and for the hints which it contains,
It is of course easy for the Times Editor ... to say what dreadful things he is about to do [at Delhi] but
it will not be [so] easy to carry his threats into effect .... He then summarized his review for D of
parliament’s discussions of the annexation of Oude, beginning with ‘the Oude Blue Book [that] was
issued on the 20th. May 1846.’ H B/XXI/R/12. See further 29618n1.

Dalhousie had declared war against Persia on 1 November 1856 and had sent out two divisions that did
not return to India until after the outbreak of the mutiny.

2 On 3 September Rathborne would reply: ‘I have only just received your note of the day before yesterday having been away from home when it came. The additional points you mention shall be borne in
mind ...” On 3 September, Haydon would assure D that he quite appreciated the value of Rathborne’s
services, although the two of them had had differences: ‘... by the valuable help of your kindness &
condescension to him, I think Sir I may now rely upon him in security.’ The next day he reported that
Rathborne was ‘evidently highly flattered by the honour of your suggestions and correspondence. Indeed
Sir the effect of your confidence has been most beneficial.’ H B/XXI/H/330-1, R/10. The points D makes
in 2960 and here would be the focus of the Press leader of 5 September.

ORIGINAL: PS 1497
PUBLICATION HISTORY: A.B. Rathborne ed Mr. Disraeli io Colonel Rathborne (1858) 1
EDITORIAL COMMENT: The following is the text in Rathborne’s edition.

MY DEAR COLONEL, Hughenden Manor, September 7th, 1857.
A capital article,’ and the number generally spirited.

What does the responsibility of ministers mean? Is it to be confined merely to
petty acts of administration? If it apply to anything, it should surely be to a policy.
Now the policy which annexes a state, is a policy of the highest class, la haute
politique. Such a step should be well weighed and matured, as necessarily involving
vast consequences.

The annexation of Oude was projected and rejected before finally adopted. The
concocters, therefore, must have been aware of their critical course. We have a right
to assume that it was sifted by V. Smith in his department; formally and seriously
brought before the Cabinet before sanctioned. Who can doubt it? If not so, the crime
is the greater. But assuming it was, the credit of the ministry, as statesmen, was staked
on the venture. What is the result? And when are public men to be visited by national
disapprobation, if such men, under such circumstances, are not?”

Yours sincerely, | D.

i

The recipient of this rebuke is probably Lennox, possibly in connection with the selling of the Press (see
2957&n1); for his querulousness towards D, see 3302&nn1&2. James Disraeli, who habitually accused D
of neglect (see V 1822, 18268n2, 2185&n4) is another possible recipient; the recent death of his wife
(29438&n1, 2944&n1) would account for depression. A possible political recipient is G.H. Moore, who
since July had been complaining to D that he had not been getting the party support he deserved and
had been promised. H B/XIII/200-3.

See 29608n4 and 2961&n2 for Rathborne’s leader in the Presson 5 September based on those letters from
D; Rathborne is further confirmed as the author in Haydon’s 4 September letter to D. H B/XXI/H/331.
2 On g September Rathborne would reply: ‘I am very glad you liked the article last week. The points
mentioned in your note shall be my text for this.’ The Press leader on 12 September duly echoed D’s
points. Rathborne in his letter discussed the atrocities by Indians as reactions to ‘previous pressure’,
concluding ‘that in fact they are only acts of a nature practised in similar cir[cumstan]ces of excitement
by people of the most civilized nations’, and that they should be addressed accordingly. H B/XXI/R/11.
Earlier articles in the Press, on 22 March and 5 April 1856 and presumably written by Rathborne, had
already taken this line on the annexation of Oude. See further 2965&n1.

PUBLICATION HISTORY: Lady Londonderry 164-7, dated at Hughenden 16 September 1857; M&B Iv 96-7,
dated at Hughenden 16 September 1857, the first, third and last paragraphs omitted; Bradford 235
undated and recipient incorrectly identified as SBW; Bradford 246, extract dated September 1857
EDITORIAL COMMENT: There is no salutation. Sic: is suspicious.

Hughenden | Septr. 16. 57
It was very kind of you to write to me.' I shd. have replied sooner, had I anything
to give you worth receiving. I live in a perfect, nay, a profound, solitude. I have not
seen a human being for three weeks. A certain term of this sort of life suits me, is
indeed necessary, after all the / strife, & tearing racket, of practical existence.

I wish, like you, I cd. console myself with reading novels, or even writing them;
but I have lost all zest for fiction, & have for many years. I have never read anything of Dickens, except an extract in a newspaper, &, therefore, I cannot help to
decide on the. merits of Little Dorrit.’

I never went to Manchester; tho’ / the newspapers gave an account of my visit.’
And even, if I had, there is no opinion on that affair, that I shd. so much value as
yr own. I hope, therefore, you will tell me what you thought of it, & what struck
you as to its relative position with the other great galleries of Europe — the Roman,
Florentine, Saxon &c.

One ought not to prophesy / about India, when probably the new mail has by
this time arrived, tho’ it has not reached me, for altho’ littke more than 30 miles
from town, I live in a forest, or what once was one — but I take a gloomy view of
affairs. The Ministers underrated the business from the first; they are in a scrape,
& trying to get out of it by the bullying of the “Times.”

I cannot altogether repress / a suspicion, tho’ it is only for yr own ear, that many
of the details of horrors, wh: have so outraged the sensibility of the country, are
manufactured.

The striking story of Skene at Jhansi, his deeds of heroic romance, worthy of a
Paladin, then kissing his wife & shooting her &c. &c. — all appear, now, to be
complete invention.’ This story has produced a great effect in this neighbourhood,

1 Lady Londonderry had written from Garron Tower on 28 August, astonished that D was still working
and wondering whether he would be coming to see her this year. H B/XX/V/205.

2 Lady Londonderry (n1) had discussed novels she was reading: ‘I waited till all of little Dorritt was out
& now am disap[pointe]d. What do you think of it. It will never di[s]possess (if equal) David Copperfield. I had that book 3 times & cried & laughed over it all by myself. It is true it was 5 or 6 yrs ago when
I had nothing to do.’ Dickens’s Little Dorrit had appeared in monthly numbers from December 1855 to
June 1857, David Copperfield from May 1849 to November 1850. For D’s earlier familiarity with Dickens,
see, eg, Ill 741, 889, IV 1283, etc.

3 Lady Londonderry had written (n1): ‘I finished up my matters in the North & went to Manchester
which as you have seen, I will not enlarge upon.’ The Times on 1 July had reported that the Ds on 29
June had attended the Manchester Exhibition of Art Treasures.

4 The massacre at Jhansi, in Bundelcund, had occurred on 8 June, when the rebels broke their promise
of safety for the Europeans if arms were laid down and killed all the officers, their wives and children,
including Captain Alexander Skene, 68th Regt, Bengal N.I., the superintendent of Jhansi and Jaloun,
Beatrice Margaret Herschel Skene, his 21-year-old wife, and their two infant daughters. Skene’s vakil
gave an account of the brutal massacre according to which Captain Gordon, the deputy superintendent
of Jhansi, shot himself instead of surrendering. AR (1857 History) 258, (Chronicle) 355-6; Hibbert

& I doubt not, in all others, & / I have-ne-deubt dare say stimulated subscriptions,
as it certainly has the warlike passions of the people. We must remember Captain
Jenkins’ ears. He appeared without them before the H of Commons, & the House
declared war against Spain in consequence. It afterwards turned out, that he had
lost them in the pillory, or deserved to do so.

The details of all these stories is suspicious. Details are a feature of the Myth.
The accounts are too graphic; I hate the word. Who can / have seen these things?
Who heard them? The rows of ladies standing with their babes in their arms to be
massacred, with the elder children clutching to their robes — who that wd. tell these
things, could have escaped? One lady says to a miscreant “I do not ask you to spare
my life, but give some water to my child.” The child is instantly tossed in the air &
caught upon a bayonet! Those, who invented the Skene story, might / invent
others. It was no rude hand, that forged that tale of plaintive horror. What can
there be, even in your Copperfield, like that!°

I hope you are very well. I am glad to see, that in Ireland, as well as in this Isle,
you are fulfilling, in a manner worthy of you, the duties of yr high station.’ You
set a great example, & one, wh:, while it pleases all, does not astonish me, who
have known you so long. And so, with great affection, I will now say

Good bye! | D.

377-9. The Press on 12 September had commented: ‘It appears that the first report of Captain Skene
having at the last moment of defence of the fort at this place first shot his wife and then himself, is
incorrect.’

5 The ear of Robert Jenkins (/f 1731-1738), master mariner, was cut off by the captain of a Spanish guardacosta while plundering Jenkins’s ship, on 9 April 1731, and Jenkins’s testimony about the incident before
a committee of the House in 1738 helped bring about war with Spain the following year. Later there
were questions whether Jenkins had not in fact lost the ear in the pillory, but the incident had been
confirmed by an official report from the West Indies in September 1731, long before the ear became
politically significant. DNB.

6 The British papers were full of purported first-hand accounts of atrocities in India which were inflaming
the nation to revenge. The Times's leader on 6 August had cited the bayoneted children and on 10
September it had reprinted a report of a child killed when its mother asked that it be given water; for
The Times's pro-vengeance policy see 2960&n2. Lady Londonderry had written (n1): ‘How terrible all
this India business is & especially for those who have relatives there!’ While no one questioned that
atrocities were being committed by both sides, D was not the only one (the Queen was another)
concerned that the embellishments with their racist foundation were undermining sound judgement,
and could possibly be attributed to (among others) the Europeans in India who had enormous stakes
in having their positions restored by force. Later in 1857, despite some cabinet misgivings, Delane would
send his famous Crimean correspondent W.H. Russell to India to find what evidence there was for the
horror stories. Russell would be sympathetically received by Sir Colin Campbell, and would find little
evidence to support the contentious reports, instead being impressed by the evidence of extreme
provocation by the British and disgusted by their many acts of cruel retaliation. Christopher Hibbert
Queen Victoria in Her Letters and Journals (1985) 137-8; Alan Hankinson Man of Wars: William Howard

PUBLICATION HISTORY: A.B. Rathborne ed Mr. Disraeli to Colonel Rathborne (1858) 2
EDITORIAL COMMENT: The following is the text in Rathborne’s edition. Sic: COLOLEL.

Hughenden, September 16th, 1857.
My DEAR COLOLEL,
I was very much pleased, indeed, with your article, which sustained, and more than
sustained, its excellent predecessor.’ The continuous efforts must ultimately
produce effect; and it is the only means by which effect can be achieved. We
must remember that the Press is the only journal which, at this crisis, dares speak
the truth. The influence of the East India company, in the middle classes, is
immense; it is they who have pastured on the patronage of India, and not the
aristocracy; and nothing but national calamity will ever counteract such corrupt
influences. You have also a Government in a great scrape, trying to bully through
by the aid of the Times.

I approve very much of the ideas sketched out in your last letter.’ In the present
infuriate state of the public mind, we must proceed with caution, otherwise I
cannot entirely repress a suspicion, that many of these details of outrage have been
manufactured. The striking story of Skene, at Jhansi, his deeds of heroic romance,
worthy of a Paladin, there, kissing his wife and shooting her, &c., &c., all appear
now to be complete inventions. This story has produced an enormous effect in this
neighbourhood, and I have no doubt stimulated the subscription, as it certainly has
the warlike passions, of the people. We must remember Captain Jenkins’ ears. He,
I think, appeared without them at the bar of the House of Commons, and the
House declared war against Spain in consequence. I forget whether he had previously lost them in the pillory or not, but he deserved to do so.

The detazl of those stories 1s suspicious. Details are always a feature of the myth.
The accounts are often too graphic; I hate the word. Who can have seen these
things? The row of ladies standing with their babes in their arms to be massacred,
with the elder children clutching to their robes: who that would tell these things
could have escaped? One lady says to a ruffian, “I do not ask you to spare my life,
but give some water to my child.” The child is, of course, cut in two before the
mother immediately. Those who invented the Skene story might invent others. It
was no rude hand that forged that tale of simple horror.

All this for your private ear and mind, and to relieve mine, as I do not fancy, at
this moment, John Bull cares to be undeceived.

But, perhaps, while I am writing this, you will have received the new Indian Mail
intelligence, which may change the colour of all your thoughts. If it have arrived,
it will not reach us till to-morrow, for though only thirty miles from town, we live
in the midst of a forest, or what once was one.”

Yours sincerely, | D.

the subject of wounding the sensibilities of the Public. The late news from India does not strike me as
very “cheering”, whatever effect it may have on the Times.’ H B/XXI/R/12. He was commenting on The
Times report of 17 September from the Bombay Telegraph that began: ‘The news by this mail is of a more
cheering nature than any we have yet sent home ...’ The Press leader on 19 September would contend
that the report that the worst of the mutiny might be over (which in any case could be attributed to
press censorship) was cheering only to those interested in maintaining the exploitative status quo of the
East India Company by force instead of addressing the root problem of just administration in India. It
argued that this policy was costly to every class in England, and concluded by quoting from D’s 27 July
speech that a policy of authoritative justice would ‘“do more than all the devices of all the masterminds to
secure the tranquillity of India.”’ The rest of the issue was filled with material not conducive to optimism
about the Indian situation, including reports published in a second edition about Havelock’s retreat to
Cawnpore causing ‘grave apprehensions.’ See further 2966&n1.

For Rathborne’s 19 September Press leader see 2965&n3. Haydon on 19 September had written to D: ‘I
trust Sir that our efforts this week will meet with your approbation ...’ Rathborne replied on 22 September with profuse thanks for D’s ‘most kind and flattering letter ...’ H B/XXI/H/333, R/13.

Lucas had written on 19 September: ‘I have a reference to yourself far more courteous than usual in
the 3rd Leader of the Times of this day. It is but a straw but I will tell you just what it signifies when we
meet.’ The Times in its third leader on 19 September had commented on the universal boon of railway
travel despite strenuous opposition for half of its 20 years; ‘“Railways,” said Mr. Disraeli prophetically
some years ago, “will do more than ever monasteries did,” and, though the comparison may strike some
readers as singular, it gives honourable evidence of discernment and candour.’ The leader extended the
lesson of the futility of opposition to progress to several recent pieces of progressive legislation. The
significance of the more courteous reference may be discerned in Lucas’s next letter, on 26 September:
“You will not have failed to observe how public opinion as to the causes of the outbreak is tiding round
to your own point of view, and especially how much is now ascribed to our annexation policy.’ In this
letter and the next, on 6 October, he conveyed recent information about India as D had asked.

yet quite in fact. The truth is, that our visits must be paid to you in August, or a
good deal later, for September, & the beginning of October, are / the period of

the time-honored Quarter Sessions. At all these gatherings, I have to be present,

2 The Press on 12 September had prominently reviewed Lucas’s Dacoitee in Excelsis; or, the Spoliation of Oude
by the East India Company, but without identifying the author. The reviewer — presumably Rathborne, who
on 9 September (see 2963n2) had told D there would be this review ‘in which the views expressed of
the folly of the act will be further enforced’ — took the established Press line on the topic.

3 Lucas replied (n1): ‘the impression in Town is that affairs are much graver than Indian mails or
telegraphs convey to us ..”

1 Lady Marianne (or Marian) Alford (1817-1888), born Lady Marianne Margaret Compton, eldest
daughter of 2nd Marquess of Northampton, in 1841 had married Viscount Alford, elder son of 1st Earl
Brownlow (whom he had predeceased in 1851); Alford’s maternal grandmother (Lady Amelia Hume,
born Egerton) was the sister and heir of the 8th and last Earl of Bridgewater. The Alfords’ only son,
John William Spencer Brownlow Egerton (1842-1867), in 1853 had succeeded his grandfather as 2nd
Ear! Brownlow, assuming the name Egerton in lieu of Hume Cust (in 1863 he would reassume Cust in
addition to Egerton). The issue before the Lords for several months in 1853 was the interpretation of
Bridgewater's will, which had left estates worth £70,000 p.a. to Alford on condition that he attain the
title of Duke or Marquess of Bridgewater; the first ruling, against Alford and his heir in 1853, was
reversed on appeal to the Lords a month before Brownlow succeeded his grandfather. MP (24, 29 Jun,
20 Aug 1853). The Bridgewater ttle was never revived. See further 2976&n4 and 2979.

The Indian news is most grave. The world has now found out — it is a rebellion,

denouncing the policy of vengeance instead of justice. He stressed ‘sympathy with our suffering fellowcountrymen and countrywomen in India; and also a determination to enforce upon the Government
that the preparations for the future shall be adequate to the gravity of the occasion.’ The Times on
2 October would denounce him for trying ‘to turn the present trials of the country into a means of
attacking the Ministry.’ The Times (1, 2 Oct 1857). Anthony Chester had sent him the invitation to

It would have been a great mistake not to have commented, as you have done

even in a military and political point of view (setting the question of national Character for the moment
aside) than any attempt to meet atrocity by atrocity or going one step beyond what the solemn necessity
of the case requires. Perhaps if Sir Henry Lawrence had not been quite so free with his hanging we
might not have had to lament the massacre at Cawnpore.’ See further 29708n1.

2 The Press on the 26th had published the 3 August petition to parliament by the British inhabitants of
Calcutta asking that India be governed by the British crown rather than by the East India Company,
whose mismanagement they held responsible for the mutinies. Rathborne’s leader pointed out ‘that
both the charges made in it against the Government, and the remedies suggested, are in entire
accordance with what has been constantly put forth by ourselves.’

3 Osborne in a speech to his constituents at Dover on 24 September had said: ‘I for one shall not be
satisfied until I hear that Delhi, on which I look as the modern Gomorrah, has been razed to the
ground.’ The Times (26 Sept 1857). The Press on 3 October would focus on Osborne’s concession that
errors had been made in India, and that the policy of annexation had been most destructive.

EDITORIAL COMMENT: From a typewritten copy headed: ‘D. to Ld. H. Lennox, Hughenden, Oct. 2,

"57
My dear Henry,
We returned here last night from Ashridge, and I found your interesting letter.’

C[harles] G[reville]’s facts are always more valuable than his opinions, or rather
what he chooses to circulate as his opinions, for he does not always pronounce
what he believes. I am not, however, surprised that he should say what he does
about Derby; nevertheless, I recollect that in January, 1855, he used to several
persons, and among them, I think, to yourself, exactly the same phrase. Nevertheless, we know what occurred in a couple of months.

Returning from Ashridge, I contrived to pass a day at Chicheley and dine with
the farmers at Newport Pagnell, and, tho’ the assemblage was intensely bucolic,
managed to say a few words in the right direction, tho’ with great difficulty and
caution.

Mills’s opinion, or that of any E.I. Director, goes for nothing, and no £ s. d. view
can now affect this question.” What the fate of the Government may be I do not
foresee: what it ought to be is not very difficult to pronounce. The act which
brought about the rebellion is entirely attributable to them, and they ought to be
held responsible for it. V[ernon] S[mith]’s words, in answer to me, remain: “There
is not the slightest reason to suppose that the annexation of Oude has anything
to do with this outbreak.’* Every paper now says that Oude is the centre of the
rebellion.

We shall stay here till Q. Sess. are over, late this year, and then go to Devon.

Yours ever, D.

Lennox had written on 15 September from Gordon Castle, where Newcastle had told him ‘that he
expected worse accounts until October; but that then, he thought, complete victory would be with the
English.’ He had written from the same place again on 27 September to convey ‘the report, our friend
Charles Greville, brings us from Balmoral, where, he has been to the Council ... He says, he is in a maze
of doubt, about our future in India; that Granville & Clarendon, with the other Ministers, are in a great
state of anxious alarm; but, that Pam alone, laughs at any real danger, & is confident of complete
success ... Pam seems low in CGs estimation, but he says, nothing else will or can go down ... Derby, he
considers, quite an impossibility ... The Times appears to be at its wits end & not to know, at all what to
do or say.’ H B/XX/LX/g0-1. Greville VII 300 corroborates Lennox’s report.

2 Lennox (n1) had written on 27 September: ‘[Greville] saw Chas Mills, who is an E.I. Director last week,
& he told him he had grave doubts, whether it would be worth while, to reconquer India; that the cost,
would be so enormous ...’ Charles Mills (1792-1872), of Hillingdon Court, Middlesex, JP and DL, ist Bt
1868, a director of the East India Company, would in 1858 be one of the original members of the
Council of India (chosen by the company).

3 Vernon Smith, as president of the board of control and therefore the member of cabinet directly

responsible for the East India Company and the government’s India policy, had responded in this

fashion to D’s three-hour speech on India on 27 July (see 2948&n4): ‘The right hon. Gendeman has
completely failed to connect the case of Oude with this outbreak. I can see no connection between the

two, nor can I imagine that there can be any ...’ Hansard CXLVII cols 481-505 (quoted at 490).

ORIGINAL: PS 1501
PUBLICATION HISTORY: A.B. Rathborne ed Mr. Disraeli to Colonel Rathborne (1858) 3
EDITORIAL COMMENT: The following is the text in Rathborne’s edition.

MY DEAR COLONEL, Hughenden, October 4th, 1857
Your article’ is admirable. You have completely developed the train of thought
which I touched upon very imperfectly. Indeed, I was dancing in fetters, and could
scarcely squeeze in what I contrived to do, which was very little to my satisfaction,
but better than nothing. I long to make a speech on India, where “politics are
admitted,” but after all, the best place for that is the House of Commons.”

I think your article, both as respects knowledge, correctness of view, and style,
one of the best, if not the best, of leading articles I know.

The number, also, is very spirited, the third article especially, “Ministers on
India,” is extremely telling, and ought to be circulated throughout the country.”

I heard from a source, not to be mistaken, that up to nearly the last day of the
month, the ministers, with the exception of Palmerston, were quite in despair
about India, especially Clarendon and Granville, from whom the Times, mainly by
the aid of C. Greville,* obtain their cue. This was the cause of the flattering tone
of the 77mes; but the arrival of the Calcutta Mail changed everything, and out came
the bullying article of Friday, “Mutiny, and nothing but Mutiny, as we always said,”
&e., &e.”

bend

See 2970n3 for Rathborne’s 3 October leader.

See 2968n2 for D’s 30 September speech at Newport Pagnell. D had prefaced his remarks on India with

a reference to the chairman’s strictness ‘in preventing any admixture, however slight, of party politics

in these agricultural assemblages - a principle which I always uphold ...’ Rathborne replied on 5

October: *... how ardently I long for the moment when you will be able to touch in the House of

Commons those Chords which when touched rightly find a response in every breast throughout the land

... What could be a more glorious claim on the nation’s gratitude[,] what bring more undying renown

upon themselves, than to have restored that Empire in India which the Whigs had all but lost.’

H B/XXI/R/ 15.

3 The third article in the Press of 3 October had recounted the ‘mass of imbecility, ignorance, and neglect’
comprising the statements and behaviour of ministers since 21 July 1856 when Vernon Smith, in
announcing the annexation of Oude, had allowed that this had caused disaffection among the sepoys:
‘... [ministers] systematically depreciated the danger, distorted facts, rejected the advice of experience,
and for months repudiated the only means by which the insurrection could have been restrained ...’ See
further 2974&n4.

4 As recently as 1855, Greville had expressed contempt for The Times and shame at his (very slight)
connection with it. Greville VII 132; Koss Political Press 113-14.

5 Lennox was the ‘source’ of this information; see 2971&n1. Lucas seems to have been one of D’s current

contacts at The Times, on 26 September he had written: ‘Vernon Smith and Delane were anticipating last

night that they should hear that General Havelock’s force was used up or destroyed, that Lucknow
might be gone and Agra in great danger ...’ H B/XXI/L/382. The Times in a second edition on 1 October,
and again on 2 October, had published ‘files of Calcutta papers to the 23d of August’ just received. Its
leader based on them predicted that ‘the real war ... must begin in September, and end in May ... and
that next Spring will find us holding India with a stronger grasp than we ever did before ... Notwithstanding certain taunts at our want of prescience or want of capacity to comprehend the fact, this is only

a military revolt, inspired by those causes and motives that prevail most with the military character ...’

The Press on 3 October had countered by declaring the public’s gratitude ‘that, amid the shoals and

quicksands that beset us, there has stood forth a statesman like Mr. Disraeli to point out from the first

the true nature of the crisis ... and to show us the means by which alone it could successfully be met.’

repaying atrocity by atrocity was both an error and a crime ...’

Hibbert 323. The news would arrive at the foreign office by telegram on 26 October. AR (1857 Chronicle) 204, 215. Lucknow would not be finally recovered until March 1858; see 30898n4. Parliament had
been prorogued until 6 November; on 4 November this would be extended to 17 December but on 16
November would be moved up to 3 December, the date on which it eventually assembled. Hansard
CXLViI col 2094; The Times (5, 17 Nov 1857).

See 2957&n1. Haydon had written to D on 3 October that he thought Rose, who had been looking
over the Press, was ‘disposed to give up the paper. I confess,’ he allowed, ‘I should be glad to get it from
him ...” Lennox had written on ‘Wednesday’: ‘I heard yesterday a few alarmed lines, from Poor Haydon;
announcing Roses return.’ Rose would reply to D on 5 October from Park Street that he had returned
‘quite invigorated in health and energy.’ See also 2940n1. He and his wife had set out to visit the Ds at
Hughenden on Wednesday, but had gone no farther than Wycombe on learning they were not at home.
He was eager to see D, as he had been looking into Press matters and found them ‘on the whole
satisfactory’ with practically no debt, a growing balance at the bank, and receipts exceeding expenses;
‘the ship is therefore afloat, my chief difficulty now arises from occasional insubordination among the
crew, which has too much Irish material in its composition.’ H B/XXI/H/335, XX/LX/Q9Q, R/I/B/31. See

Roses’ eldest daughter was Margaret Amelia Rose (1842-1882).

My dear H..,'
I hear from a 1st. rate quarter, that things were thought so bad at the end of last
month, that the “Times” was on the point of publishing a Crimean Manifesto, and
attacking everybody and everything, when the Calcutta mail, four days later than
the Bombay, arrived, and then everything changed, and the extra bullying article
of Thursday “Mutiny, nothing but a mutiny, as we always said” &c. appeared.”

They have now, 1.e., the Government, evidently staked all upon Delhi immediately falling, and Agra at least being saved. If the next news do not bear this out, I
should not be surprised they would call Parliament together in November....°

J think the manner in which the “Press” has been conducted during the last six
weeks, has never been excelled, and that in the best columns of the “Times” more
masterly leaders, both as regards matter, and style, and tone, never appeared. The No.
of yesterday, I think, perfect. The leader first rate, and the 3rd. article: “Ministers on
India” ought to be printed separately and circulated throughout the counwy...'

Frederic Wordsworth Wellesley Haydon (1827-1886), second son of Benjamin Haydon the historical
painter, at about this ume took over as editor of the Press, the first extant dated letter from him in this
capacity is one of 31 August 1857. H B/XXI/H/329. After the paper was sold (see 3103n1; as late as 1870
he would think that “Rose would have done better to have sold it to me, than to have utterly destroyed
it as he did’), b was instrumental in getting him appointed sub-inspector in the factory department of
the home office. LPOD (1859). In 1858-9 he would also be involved with the New Quarterly Review (‘my
first Literary Property’ ~ see also 29938cn1 and app 1 1366xn1) and taking direction from D for its
political position. Fired by Gathorne Hardy in 1867 for criticizing officials in the home office, Haydon
for the rest of D's life would periodically write to him about his dismissal (petitions for inquiries) and
for help getting a pension or another public appointment; a detailed printed petition addressed to the
Queen accompanies a copy of his letter to Home Secretary Bruce dated 14 April 1869. H B/XXI/H/345,
347, 358, 397-400. 404, 406, 425. He would publish Benjamin Robert Haydon, his Correspondence and Table
Talk in 1876.

2 See 2972&n 5.

3 See 2972&n6.

4 Rathborne in his letter to D of this day (see 2972n3) wrote: ‘The third article was Haydon’s. He showed
it me before he inserted it, and it then struck me as excellent and entirely to the point.’ Haydon on 8
October would express his pleasure at the praise in D’s letter of ‘Monday last’. On 10 October Haydon
would write: ‘If | had been well enough I intended Sir to have followed up the “Ministers upon India”
by showing what they had done. based upon the Military Return I have obtained from Head Quarters.’

Pakington had spoken on India to the Worcester Agricultural Association on 2 October, seeing the
‘magnitude of the crisis’ as ‘a deeply organized, long matured conspiracy, with the object of exterminating the English from India.” The ‘crime must be punished,’ but it should be ‘done in no vindictive
spirit. Let justice be tempered with mercy.’ In India, he said, tortures had been practised with English
knowledge. if not authority. ‘litde less horrible than those which we now deplored.’ The crown’s

confident, that, if the party will only act like sensible men, they may attain a far
higher position, than / any, that, for years past, they have held. What could be a
more sure basis for public confidence, & a more glorious claim for a nations
gratitude, than to restore that Empire in India, wh: the Whigs have all but lost?

I see old Henley is at his tricks again. It is really intolerable, / that, because his
father was an E. Ind: shipbuilder, the party is to be broken up at such a crisis.” He
it was, who mainly threw us in 1853 into that painful minority on Stanleys motion
for the postponement of legislation until the enquiry was concluded; a motion, wh:,
if / largely supported, wd. have been now a stepping stone to power, & the defeat
of wh:, I really believe, was the true cause, that Stanley refused my proposal in 1856
to bring forward the Oude case. However, I am resolved, that Henley shall not
again play this game. The government of India must be one of the main / springs
on wh: any ministry can now be formed, & I have myself not a doubt, that, if the
Tories go straight on this & hold together, the defection from the commercial
ranks of the Government wd. be large.‘

We have been here, with the exception of a few days at Ashridge, since the
middle of August, enjoying this charming season. My wife unites with / me in kind
remembrances to Lady Pakington, who I hope is quite well.

I trust you see the “Press”. The series of articles on India in that paper are from
a master hand, Colonel Rathborne, the right hand of Napier, & formerly Collector
in Scinde. He is lord of his subject, &, both in point of knowledge & commanding
style, his writings must produce / considerable influence on opinion. He wrote,
about two years ago, a series of articles on Indian affairs in the “Press” against
Dalhousiism but Ld. D:, by the agency of Lady Ely, choked them off: that is,
frightened or cajoled the Editor. However, sufficient appeared to establish the
paper as some authority on these matters.” It was with the utmost difficulty, & only

authority must be re-established, and India thereafter be better governed. The Times (5 Oct 1857); Press
(10 Oct 1857). For D’s speech at Newport Pagnell along similar lines see 2968n2 and 2972n2. Pakington
on 8 October ‘was very glad to find that we had spoken so much in the same spirit on India .... He had
not seen the report of D’s speech until after making his own. H B/XX/P/33.

2 Taken from Rathborne’s 5 October letter; see 2972n2.

3 Henley, president of the board of control in the 1852 Derby government, in a speech on 10 September
at Thame, Oxon, had made a bloodthirsty call for vengeance in India, regarding it as ‘futile to say that
England has in its government of India exercised too strict a control.’ BH (12 Sept 1857). The Times
(12 Sept 1857) reported his contention that ‘... the events which had occurred in India had taken the
wisest and best men by surprise.’ Henley’s father was Joseph Henley (1766-1832), of Waterperry, Oxon,
high sheriff 1817, originally a prominent London merchant.

4 Pakington (n1) agreed that India ought to be ‘our great card’, but he was ‘less sanguine than you
appear to be as to the result. 1st. I suspect that Palmerston ... will defend the Ministry at the expense
of the Company. 2nd. J must confess that I distrust our party & have little confidence in their enabling
us to act ... [ suspect that you & Ld. Ellenborough & Stanley & I have little in common with the party
behind us, & that the party know it — & I suspect that we four have little in common with Ld. Derby &
Walpole & John Manners & Henley. Lytton I presume should be added to the first four.’ For the party’s
division over India in 1853 see VI 2517&n2 and 25378€n1. Just as he had rebuffed D’s proposal in 1856,
Stanley had refused an invitation on 29 January 1857 by the ex-King of Oude (via an agent) to take up
his grievance in parliament; Stanley acknowledged the wrong done the king by confiscating his kingdom
(‘an act of violent usurpation’), but felt the king had been well compensated and in any case the
legislation could not be changed now. DBP Box 46/1.

“Press” being sold to that lot of mysterious capitalists, who are buying up all the
Tory papers, &, in all probability, by this time, it wd. be writing up the E.I. Compy.

paragraphs omitted; M&B IV 97-8, dated at Hughenden 8 October 1857, extracts from the fourth
paragraph

EDITORIAL COMMENT: There is no salutation. Sic: Levison.

Octr. 8 1857
Your proposition was recd: with three times three, & one cheer more.!

I shall return from the Q. Sess: on the / 19th;’ therefore, the 20th. wd. suit us
excellently, or any other day more convenient to you. We anticipate very great
pleasure indeed from the visit with wh: / you so kindly propose to honor us.

Your letter was very interesting indeed. I see Hamilton very distinctly; a mixture
of Caliph Vathek & the late Duke; the first / contributing the rosy tapestry, & the
last the black marble staircase.”

policies such as annexation, for example, on 24 February 1855, an article on the termination of the
Burmese embassy to Calcutta over Pegu focuses on the ‘very self-sufficient personage the Marquis of
Dalhousie, who, at a cost for salary of twenty-four thousand a year, and for expenses of fifty thousand
a year more, is sowing the seeds of the ruin of India, and at the same time is building up his own
fortune at Calcutta.’ The article continues with a savage indictment of Dalhousie’s military and diplomatic incompetence. Dalhousie was related by marriage to Lady Ely, a favoured lady of the bedchamber.
According to Rathborne’s 1860 Letter (see 2960&phé&n1), it was Derby’s suppression of his Dalhousie
articles that led him to leave the Press at that time.

6 See 29518n1, 29558nn2-4, 29578&n1, 2973&n1 and 29748n1. Pakington (n1) agreed that to sell the Press,
which he saw regularly, ‘would be a serious loss to us ...’ D evidently reported similarly to Malmesbury,
who in his 15 October reply was confused by D’s pronouns, and thought the India articles had been
written by Sir William Napier, not Rathborne. H B/XX/HS/59. On 8 October Haydon would again write
to D about buying the Press; he felt £5,000 was too high, especially as the type was originally bought
cheaply and would have to be replaced, and he asked D for a clear idea of what price might be acceptable. H B/XXI/H/336. See further 3060n1.

 

Lady Londonderry had written on ‘Sunday’ from Glasgow (postmarked 6 October), where she and Lord
Adolphus were stopping on their way to Wynyard and had been reading D’s “admirable speech’ (see
29688n2): ‘It is impossible not to feel very anxious abt things in India which seems in a fearfully critical
state — had the Govt only sent troops overland how much might have been spared!’ She continued: ‘Do
you know I am seriously meditating a visit to you. 1 have always wished it ever since that most kind &
feeling invitation you gave me 3 yrs ago [see VI 2696&nn2&3] but I never saw my way to accomplishing
it... [ think of going to London the goth for a few days & I have promised to go for 2 or 3 to Blenheim

& I could go to you for one I think “if so be & purvided” all suited ... Mrs D’Israeli may have settled

something quite opposed to this.” H B/XX/V/206.

2 See 29688€n3.

3 Lady Londonderry (nt: had written: ‘| have been to see Hamilton Palace which is very fine ... 1 should
like to be allowed to pick things out of it like plums out of a cake ... but I declare if I had it I should
not know how to live in it. There is a black marble staircase (oh so gloomy) & a picture gallery 120 feet
long & a most quaint shaped Library ... for the Beckford books ... There are miles of rooms & such

We have been here since the middle of August, enjoying the charming scene &
season, with the exception / of a visit to Ashridge, who counts as a neighbour, &
is a constituent.* The castle is of Wyatt Gothic, but very costly, & with all its faults,
its extended principal front produces a fine & great effect. The / Park, for extent,
scenery, & timber is beyond all praise. It is in fact a castle in a forest, & only thirty
miles from the largest city known in ancient or modern times.” We met therefer
there a lively party: / the Ebringtons,° Lady Brownlow,’ F. & Lady Margaret Levison, the female Lyndhursts,” Stafford, Powis family, '° & a troop of cavaliers. In
the evening they performed charades, with all the neighbours & servants assembled
/ & admitted. Nothing cd. be worse. Except Stafford, who is capital, not a perser
performer had the slightest dramatic talent. They all seemed to cluster round
Stafford like bees, with their backs to the audience & mumbling / in a nervous
whisper; occasionally a giggle, the last despair of mauvaise honte. Our hostess, who
is as kind as she is agreeable, thought they were not applauded enough, & we
organised some claqueurs; / but this finished the business. The rehearsal in the
morning of a charade took three hours, & the performance cd. never be spun out
to ten minutes! At last Mr Stafford went away in despair & the / company took
refuge in a more congenial round game."!

Tell Adolph: that I have read the pamphlet, wh: was well worth reading.

lovely old tapestry — rose de Boni [szc] & flowers as if it was painted. I hate tapestry generally & gt. grim
figures but this ought to be under glass. No flower garden — mag[nificen]t Park & such a hideous heavy
Mausoleum the Duke built for himself & there he lies in a sort of Egyptian marble mummy! all covered
with hieroglyphics.’ The current palace had been built in the classical style in 1822-9 by Alexander
Hamilton Douglas (1767-1852), 10th Duke of Hamilton and 7th Duke of Brandon, KG 1836, FRS, FSA, LL
of Lanarkshire, son-in-law of William Beckford (author of Vathek - cf VI 23008n1), MP for Lancaster
18026.

Slapton Manor. VH-B III 412.

5 Ashridge Castle, Berkhampstead, Herts, had been extensively rebuilt in 1808-14 in the Gothic style by
James Wyatt (1746-1813), also the architect for William Beckford’s Fonthill; the interior of Ashridge was
currently (1855-63) being remodelled in the Italian style by Matthew Digby Wyatt, of the same family.

6 Lord Ebrington in 1847 had married Georgiana Augusta Charlotte Caroline Dawson Damer (1826-1866),
eldest daughter of Col George Lionel Dawson Damer and his wife, Mary Georgiana Emma, daughter
of Lord Hugh Seymour; Lady Ebrington was thus the granddaughter of 1st Earl of Portarlington and
great-granddaughter of 1st Marquess of Hertford.

1845), JP, DL for Surrey, Liberal Mp for Derby 1847, for Stoke-upon-Trent 1852-7, for Bodmin 1859-85,
in 1853 had married Lady Margaret Compton (1830-1858), sister of 3rd Marquess of Northampton.

9 Lady Lyndhurst’s only child and Lyndhurst’s only surviving unmarried daughter was Georgiana Susan
Copley (1838-1926), who in 1863 would marry Sir Charles Du Cane.

10 The (unmarried) Lord Powis and his brother Col Percy Herbert were currently at Ashridge. MP (13 Oct
1857).

11 In her 13 October reply from Wynyard Lady Londonderry remarked: ‘Your description of the acting is
impayable.’ H B/XX/V/207. In the meantime, Sarah had written to MA, on 1 October: ‘I heard from Miss
Copley yesterday all about the Charade & the Epilogue. I did not betray your opinion of the acting, but
it could not be worse than her own ...’ The 45-year-old Stafford would live only until 15 November;
Sarah would write to MA on the 26th: ‘Poor Mr Stafford — it is a lesson to a man not to die, however he
may live, a bachelor — a sensible tender woman would have saved him from his nurses, if not from his
Doctors ...” H D/I1/A/436, 439.

Hughenden Manor | Octr. 15. 1857.
I send you a line to tell you what we have been doing, & what we propose to do.
When I wrote last,’ we were on the point of paying a visit to Lady Marian Alford,
at Ashridge Castle, / &, I think, I told you all about her, & hers.

Ashridge is a wonderful place — a castle in a forest, & not thirty miles from town!
The present building was raised by the late Lord Bridgewater, at the commencement of this century, in the vitious Gothic of the time, but regardless / of expense
— &, tho’ all its details are wrong, the aggregate, from its extent, is very imposing.
It is a sort of Windsor, wh: was restored to its present style by the same architect,
Wyatt, who happened to know a little of Gothic architecture, when the world knew
nothing, / & wanted to know a great deal. Fortunate man, he has built a good
percentage of all the great houses in England! Unhappy country, that such an
opportunity sho[ul]d have fallen to such hands! At Ashridge, the great hall, the
great tower, the Chapel, &c. &c. are all Gothic but all of different ages & / incongruous ornament. But Nature is independent, not only of architects, but of Art
itself — & no words can describe the variety, & beauty, & size, & age, of the trees
at Ashridge — with every variety succession of woodland burst; ferns taller than the
Life Guards; & herds both of red, & fallow, deer.

After this, we went to Chicheley Hall, Mr Chesters, / that I might be present at
the Agricultural Meeting, & then we got home; a week away.

The Quarter Sess: are the 19th. of this month; the latest ever known, they will be
over by the 22nd: &, very soon after that, we shall pay you a visit. I shd. have fixed
the day now, & engaged our rooms at once, but / Lady Londonderry; (Frances
Anne, the great Marchioness & orator! — ) pays her first visit to her daughter, the
new Duchess of Marlborough,” about that time, & has written to propose we shd.
receive her for a day at Hughenden, in her way back from Blenheim to London.
She is a very old friend, & we can’t well refuse / — but its it loses me a week.

I agree with you about the superiority of seabathing to the bath;’ but my frame
cannot stand seabathing except in summer.

2 MA’s accounts record neither the ‘engagement at home’ on the 15th nor the visit on the 16th.

MY DEAR COLONEL, Hughenden, October 18th, 1857.

The enclosed arrived here, yesterday. Alas! too late! Had it been Friday, I would

have sent it vou, instantly, by a special messenger.

The National Association for the Promotion of Social Science had been founded at Birmingham on 12
October with Lord Brougham the inaugural speaker, followed next day by the presidents of the
association’s five departments: Lord John Russell, jurisprudence and amendment of law; Pakington,
education; Stanley, public health; Sir Benjamin Brodie (for Lord Lyttelton), soctal economy; and
Matthew D. Hill, recorder of Birmingham (for the Bishop of London), punishment and reformation.
In his speech on that day (the only one of which D at Hughenden would have yet seen a report) Stanley
defined public health as disease prevention in the population at large, and argued for legislation by
detailed analyses of mortality statistics which, nevertheless, were only a poor measure of the problem:
‘The real and lasting injury lies in the deterioration of race, in the seeds of disease transmitted to future
generations, in the degeneracy and decay which are never detected tll the evil is irreparable ... It
concerns us if the work of England be that of colonization and of dominion abroad, if wild hordes and
savage races are to be brought by our agency under the influence of civilized man, if we are to maintain
peace, to extend commerce ... It concerns us, I say, that strong hands shall be forthcoming to wield
either sword or spade — that vigorous constitutions be not wanting to endure the vicissitudes of climate
and the labours of a settler in a new country.’ He was ‘loudly cheered’. That evening at the Birmingham
and Midland Institute, Stanley had made another speech, on the great success of such institutions: *... he
believed that no more useful work could be done than to educate a man so as to give him a higher
sense of his intellectual being, and that there need be no fear of raising up a class dissatisfied with their
station.’ On 14 and 15 October a number of papers were read in Stanley's department, and he contributed to the discussion of sanitation issues, On the evening of 15 October he would make a speech in
support of reformatories. The Times (14-17, 19 Oct 1857). Stanley took extensive notes on the proceedings. DBP Box 46/2.

and perplexed councils, of Calcutta.

I have only just been able to glance at the Press, with the exception of your most
interesting article.’

NOTE. — Lord John Russell, at Birmingham, has staked his credit, on the “mutiny”
being extinguished before the meeting of Parliament.* Lord Ellenborough does not
seem to be of that opinion.?

EDITORIAL COMMENT: Sic: toos.

G.M.W. Peacocke Esqr Hughenden Manor | Octr. 20. 1857
My dear Peacocke,
I have heard of your affliction with sincere grief. This has been an unlucky year,
but the law of reaction will make affairs brighten. / Pray let some one about you
write to me, as to your state, prospects, & progress. There are skilful men at Dublin, wh: is something.’

If I do not dwell upon yr misfortune, it is only because I think it better rather
to distract you / from its too absorbing contemplation.

You used to like news: I send you some.

The last dates from Calcutta in the newspapers are the 9th. Septr.”? — but there
are letters, at least there is one letter, in London of the morning of the 10th:,
written / ten minutes before the packet started.

1 See 2982&nn2&3 where D describes the latest newspaper reports and a 10 September letter from
Calcutta. Rathborne forwarded the information to Sir William Napier; see 2987&n1.

2 Russell had made this prediction on 14 October; see 2980n1. The Times (16 Oct 1857). Rathborne replied
on the 20th: *... I suspect that the result of Lord John Russells Birmingham prophecy will be merely to
add another illustration of the truth of Sydney Smith’s satire regarding his self sufficiency in dealing with
matters which he does not understand ...’ H B/XX1/R/16.

3 Ellenborough in a letter to the Winchcomb Agricultural Association dated 16 October had been gloomy
about the prospects in India: ‘What at first was a mutiny is become a revolution; to restore civil authority
is more difficult than to repress military resistance, and it requires more force to occupy than it does
to subdue. Be assured that the miltary institutions of this country, managed as they now are, are
insufficient permanently to supply the number of men required to reconquer what we have lost, and
to hold our empire hereafter in security.’ MP (17 Oct 1857). Ellenborough on this day (the 18th) was
sending D a corrected copy of the “Speech letter’ as published on the 17th. H B/XXI/E/161, 161a.

1 Peacocke had had a shooting accident in Ireland; Rose on 22 October would provide details of the ‘very
narrow escape. The shot went thro his hand into his face near the carotid artery, passed out at his neck &
thro his hair and hat & he has lost two fingers permanently but hopes to have good use in his right hand
yet.’ HR/I/B/33. Peacocke on 25 October at a Dublin hotel would write, using his left hand, that he hoped
with time to recover the use of his right. H B/XXI/P/139. In March, Peacocke had lost his seat at Maldon.

2 The most recent mail from India had included reports from Calcutta to the 9th, Madras to the 12th and
Bombay to the 17th September that were published in the Press on 17 October; the 9 September
Calcutta report, received at East India House on 13 October, reported Havelock still at Cawnpore
awaiting reinforcements and Lucknow still unrelieved but withstanding assaults. The Press leader had
cautioned that it was premature to interpret these reports as evidence that the tide in India had turned,
as other papers were doing.

It contains this. H.M. 10th. Regt, wh: was at Dinapore, is in full mutiny, demanding the release of some of their comrades, who are about to be punished by the
Govt, in consequence of firing into some “loyal” sepoys. These Sepoys were part
of / that native regiment, wh: mutinied, & afterwards effected the ambuscade at
Arrah, by wh: 200 men of H.M. 10th. were destroyed. The 10th. believe, that the
mutineers were instructed by these “loyal” Sepoys, who remained behind.

The Commanding officer of H.M. 10th. had for some days, but in vain, warned
the Govt, that unless a conciliatory course / were adopted, the worst consequences
might be feared. Ld. Canning was firm, & this is the result. But hardly the worst,
for H.M’s regiments at Calcutta, & up the country, as far as All[a]Jhabad, have
declared that they will stand, or fall, by their brethren of the 10th.’

So there are now two mutinies, & both have been similarly occasioned!

This / last may really be styled “a mere military mutiny[.]”

This news will go far to explain the perplexing & unsatisfactory accounts from
Calcutta: the delays, countermandings, toos & fros of Outram, Gapt Campbell 8c
&e.”

3 D’s account from the 10 September letter he has seen corresponds with the published reports as far as
the events at Dinapore are concerned (MP commenting: ‘We regret to be obliged to record that a party
of the Queen’s 10th have set discipline at defiance, and committed some atrocities ...’), but what ‘the
10th. believe’, the commanding officer’s warnings and the threatened secondary mutiny have not been
found reported elsewhere. The Times, MP (17 Oct 1857). The Press leader on 24 October ventured to
publish the report: “We learn from sources that we see no reason to doubt ... that most unmistakeable
signs of mutiny have made themselves apparent among the European troops ...’ However, it stopped
short of vouching for the report that the commanding officer of a regiment had communicated to the
governor-general that the European troops were supporting those making demands on him. The
commander of the 10th (North Lincoln) Regiment was Lt-Col Patrick Fenwick (1820-1863); his men
were furious with him for letting escape the sepoys (there were in fact three native regiments that
mutinied, the 7th, 8th and 40th) that had ambushed the British troops and Sikhs at Attah. There was
also ‘deepest disgust’ at the appointment of Peter Grant with his ‘native proclivities’ as the lieutenantgovernor of the central provinces. MP (21, 25 Sept, 2, 16 Oct 1857). The commander, nominally until
29 October, of the Dinapore division was Maj-Gen George W.A. Lloyd (d 1865), an ‘old, gouty man’ who
refused to do more than remove the percussion caps from the disaffected regiments; see further n5.
Hibbert 132-7; Penderel Moon The British Conquest and Dominion of India (1989) 723-7.

5 Sir fames Outram (1803-1863), CB 1843, KCB 1856, GCB 1857, KCSI 1861, tst Bt 1858, cadet in India 1819,
maj-gen 1854 (It-gen in the Indian army), chief commissioner at Lucknow when in November 1856 he
had been sent to Persia as commander, in August had been given the command of the Dinapore and
Cawnpore divisions; after his arrival with reinforcements at Cawnpore on 5 September there was
confusion when he, nominally in overall command but deferring to Gen Havelock in the long-delayed
relief of Lucknow (Havelock having aborted a previous march to the Oudé capital), nevertheless
repeatedly countermanded Havelock’s orders. Sir Colin Campbell (1792-1863), born Macliver, veteran
of the Peninsular, opium, second Sikh and Crimean wars (the last as a commander), CB 1842, KCB 1849,
GCB 1855, KCSL 1861, lt-gen 1856, gen 1858, was created Baron Clyde 1858, field-marshal 1862; Campbell
had arrived at Calcutta on 17 August 1857 as commander-in-chief and soon acquired the nickname ‘Sir
Crawling Camel’ for his caution, having to reorganize the administrative and transport departments
before advancing to the front. He would not reach Cawnpore until 3 November (unavoidably delayed
by primitive transportation), and would lead the second relief of Lucknow on 16 November. Hibbert
259-60, 332-46. Haydon on 17 October had thought that, ‘if we could obtain any authentic information
as to the position of affairs at Calcutta between Lord Canning & Colin Campbell, & the general way in
which affairs are being conducted, it would afford us good material ..." H B/XXI/H/339. Peacocke (n1)
replied: *... the news about the 10th: is very serious & places Ld Canning on the horns of a dilemma.
Is he to call in the Sikhs to put down the 1oth:’.

the postponement of his marriage / with “Miss Kincaid Lennox” in consequence

PUBLICATION HISTORY: Francis Edwards catalogue 1039 (1982) item 173, described as: ‘ALS (‘D’) to
Sir H. Rawlinson ... 4 sides, 8vo, Hughenden Manor, 25th October, 1857’

{telling him that] Adolphus Vane is suddenly & dangerously ill, & his Mother ...
is obliged to renounce going to Blenheim ... As the time is also one not very
convenient to yourself we propose ... to postpone our party [making other arrangements. ]!

6 MPon 16 October had announced: ‘We are requested to state that the Viscount Strangford’s marriage
with Miss Kincaid Lennox is postponed on account of his lordship’s severe indisposition.’ Strangford
in late 1856 in Egypt had met Margaret Kincaid Lennox (1829-1892), eldest daughter of John Lennox
Kincaid Lennox, of Lennox Castle, Stirlingshire, and in spite of rapidly advancing tuberculosis had been
living with her in England, Scotland and France. On 14 September, in reply to D’s letter (not found)
describing him as ‘a bed-ridden Lovelace,’ he had asked for Rose’s address, ‘in case I have to give away
a Coronet upon a Deathbed ... Ill as I am — of course I look only to my Brother’s Interests.’ BEA.
Peacocke (n1), who had seen Strangford in September and feared ‘nothing short of a miracle can save
him’, replied that in Strangford’s letters to him, mostly dictated to Margaret Lennox, he did not
mention the marriage: ‘from what I know I do not believe it; should it be true it will be about as you
suppose only there [are] a good many previous claimants for the legacy’. H B/XXI/P/139. In late
October Strangford and Margaret Lennox had gone to Bradgate Park, Leics, home of a former mistress
and Astley’s equestrienne, now the Countess of Stamford and Warrington. H R/1/B/35a. There he would
marry Margaret Lennox on 9 November and die on 23 November, his title passing to his only surviving
brother, Percy, the residual legatee of his less than £7,000 estate; he explained in his will that he was
leaving his wife only her personal effects and the balance of their joint account because of her ‘express
desire’ that the marriage not affect his family in any way. On 19 November, Lady Strangford would write
to D on Strangford’s behalf, asking urgently for the return of a packet of letters in which Strangford had
given details of their affair, and thanking D for his *kind letters’ to Strangford in his illness. H B/XXI/S/
653. The Dowager Lady Strangford in 1861 would marry the younger brother of gnd Lord Bateman,
Charles Spencer Bateman Hanbury, who in 1862 would take the additional surname of Kincaid Lennox.

See 2976&n12. Lady Londonderry had written on 24 October from Holdernesse House: ‘Adolphus has
been taken ill with rush of blood to the head & fainting & I have had to put off going to Blenheim &
I see no hope of getting to you ...” On the 27th she would write: “Thank God he is better ...’ She hoped
she would see D in town before she returned north on the 4th. H B/XX/V/208-9. H. Montgomery Hyde
(Londonderrys 54-6) describes Lord Adolphus’s sad fate: ‘... the rigours of two Crimean winters had
seriously undermined his health, and towards the end of 1857 he suffered what it is charitable to
describe as a nervous breakdown’; he thereafter would have increasingly frequent and serious attacks
of mental illness until his death in 1864. Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson (1810-1895), the Assyriologist,
DCL (Oxford) 1850, KCB 1856, LLD (Cambridge) 1862, GCB 1889, 1st Bt 1891, second son of the late
Abram Tyzack Rawlinson of Chadlington, Oxfordshire, most recently consul-general at Baghdad 1843-55,
would be Liberal MP for Reigate in 1858 (until appointed by the crown to the newly created Council of
India), for Frome 1865-8. An undated dinner invitation to D from Lytton for ‘Wednesday next 11th’
included Rawlinson with ‘much to say about Persia ...’ H B/XX/LY/205.

His Grace | The D. of Rutland October 26. 1857

Dear Duke of Rutland,

I was very much pleased, indeed, with what you said about our Indian affairs, the

other day, at Leicester.' / You spoke boldly, & you hit the right nail on the head.
Pardon this intrusion from an old companion in arms, & a very sincere friend.
D.”

1 See 29808cn1; in his speech, Brougham had defined the primary objectives of social science: *... furthering the improvement and securing the stability of the social system; correcting the faults and supplying
the defects of our institutions upon sound, rational, and temperate views, and rendering desperate all
attempts either to check the progress of improvement or to gratify the wild desires of those who would
destroy rather than amend; in a word, steering the middle course between those who regard all change
as pernicious and those whom no change will satisfy.’ He had also taken an active part in the rest of the
conference. The Times (14-17 Oct 1857}.

2 Brougham on 20 February had sent D ‘a present of the smallest possible value — the last vols of the
Glasgow edition of my works.’ He thought D might find that the volume containing some of his speeches
would carry him back ‘to days long since gone by ...” On 25 May he had written to praise D’s speech on
parliamentary reform ‘to the Bucks folks’ (see 2938n1); he disagreed with most of it, but thought it a
valuable contribution to the necessary discussion. On 28 October he would reply ‘beyond measure
gratified’ with D's letter, and in a postscript comment: ‘It is impossible to state too strongly the credit
which our friend Stanley gained on ail hands at the Birmingham Congress ...’ H B/XXI/B/ 1016-18. See
further 2994&n2.

The former Lord Granby had succeeded his father as 6th Duke of Rutland on 20 January. On 22
October he had addressed a meeting at Leicester to raise funds for sufferers from the Indian mutiny.
He thought this was not the time to investigate the causes of the mutiny, which, he was confident, would
soon be crushed, and hoped that victory would be followed by a display of Christianity, not vengeance:
‘Justice, and severe justice must be done: but let us discriminate between the guilty and the innocent.’
The Times (23 Oct 1857}

2 Rutland on 4 November was much gratified by the letter ‘from one so eminent, ... so old a Friend, and
for whom I have so true a regard’ About India he commented: ‘I trust now the worst is over, though
it must take a long time again to consolidate our Empire.’ H B/XXI/R/339. D and Rutland had been
‘companions in arms since at least 1846. See [Vv 1501ff.

Since D’s last communication with Carlisle (see 2942&n1), Capt Fisher in Ceylon on 20 July and again
on 22 September had forwarded copies, as per D’s request of 12 June 1857 (not found), of his correspondence with Messrs Dawson, Dickson 8& Co in Colombo about protecting Villiers’s Ceylon rents from
other potential claimants and sending them to London to pay Magenis’s claim. Fisher’s covering letter
to D of 22 September explained that ‘the object of Messrs. Dawson & Co is simply that they may charge
a commission on Villiers money’, and advised D to object to this unnecessary ‘interference’. Francis
Villiers on 27 September at Nantes had thanked D for his letter of the 24th (not found) and for
previously forwarding one from Strangford. He thanked D for the trouble he was taking, could not
comprehend ‘the behaviour of others towards me’, and discussed the Indian situation at some length.
His mother had written most recently on 3 September and on 18 October, when she concluded: ‘I write
to Spain for his birthday — I cannot help always hoping that the natural affections will again revive — I
have now no other hope for Him!! — my heart can never recover — but I do not forget the kindness with
which you brightened my Sorrow.’ H A/IV/J/53, 55-9.

2 Carlisle replied from Lincoln’s Inn on 27 October that, as D had not replied to his letter of 25 September, D ‘probably had no objection to our agents receiving the rents and remitting them directly to me
for Mr Magenis, as it would save you the trouble ... I therefore by the last mail requested our agents to
apply to Capt Fisher for authority to receive and remit the rents, but to take no proceedings under the
Judgment unless for the protection of Mr Magenis against other Claimants in the Island. Our agents
were also made fully aware of the arrangement that the Estates should be preserved for Mr Villiers, and
that the Rents alone should go to Mr Magenis ...” He would be happy to see D on the matter at his
convenience. H A/IV/J/60. See further 2988.

whom I had communicated the intelligence received by you from Calcutta; but without mentioning your
name ...’ He asked for the letter back. H B/XXI/R/17.

2 The Press leader on 24 October had responded to Russell’s Birmingham prediction of an early end to
the Indian mutiny (see 29818n2) by listing at daunting length what would be needed to equip an army
of 80,000 Europeans at Calcutta before it could effectively pursue and suppress all the rebels in an

PUBLICATION HISTORY: A.B. Rathborne ed Mr. Disraeli to Colonel Rathborne (1858) 3
EDITORIAL COMMENT: The following is the text in Rathborne’s edition.

MY DEAR COLONEL, Grosvenor Gate, October goth, 1857.
Should you be in town to-morrow, (Saturday,) I should be happy to see you here,
at two o’clock. We are staying at Gunnersbury,' but I shall come up in the morning, and expect to be here about one o’clock, or even twelve, which I mention, on

estimated three-month campaign. By Tuesday 27 October, the papers were preoccupied with the news
of the recapture of Delhi on 20 September. The Times on 27 November, without referring to the Press,
would itemize the predicted difficulties that in the event had not materialized; see 3001n1.

1 See 2986&nn1&2. Lord Villiers’s 24 November letter gives some cryptic information on the current state
of the affair: ‘I am quite vexed to have troubled you at so unfortunate a moment. I would not have
done so but pressed by Clifden, I wished to know the exact position in which the Ceylon affair stood,
& I] must say that I did not expect though you had held forth Hopes that your exertions would have
been as successful as they have been. I & all of us are most deeply indebted to you for this Result. As
I mentioned to you I shall apply to C Greville to be the signator, as He can say & hear much I could
not & also because He it was, who recommended that when other peculiar claims were satisfied we
should assist Clifden. From that point I propose to start & to say, that we have not yet succeeded in
effecting that object; but that we think it may be done in two or three years & then we will look to Him.
That this [is] not an empty promise I must prove & if therefore you see no objection I must state your
Ceylon arrangement. Of course there would be many minor Details, but I dont trouble you beyond the
principle of the negociation. Will you let me know what you think.’ H A/IV/J/61. See further 3012&n1.

The Ds had returned to Grosvenor Gate on 29 October, and from the 30th to 2 November were guests
of the Rothschilds at Gunnersbury. H acc. Baroness de Rothschild had written to MA earlier in October
to tell of meeting the duc d’Aumile at Strawberry Hill, and of her plan to ‘ask our royal neighbours to
honor us at dinner when Lionel comes back, and then we shall, | hope, prevail upon you to join our
circle.’ On 28 October she had written again: ‘The Duke & Duchess d’Aumale are coming to dine with
us on Saturday next the 31st., and most sincerely do I hope that you may be able to join our circle &
meet them ...’ She crossed the note with a postscript: “We shall be charmed to see you for Friday
evening. Send us a reply pr. telegraph ...” The note is docketed by MA: ‘1857 Oct 29th Mr. L de Rothschild Yes.’ H D/HI/C/1790-1.

EDITORIAL COMMENT: From a typescript copy headed ‘D. to Ld. H. Lennox, Torquay, Nov. 7. ’57.’
Lord Henry G. Lennox, M.P.
My dear Henry,
A hurried line, and, I fear, too late.!

The Government, of course, wish to make the Co. a scapegoat, and are feeling
their way to that end. This must not be allowed. At the same time, it is not for us
to vindicate the Company. If the motion of Lord Stanley, brought forward, at my
request, in 1853, had been carried, the double Government would not have been
in existence.” This is a strong point in our position.

There are two questions as regards the Government of India: one of administration, the other of policy. We have always opposed the administration of the Company, and what has occurred renders it still more expedient to reconstruct that
administration; but the primary cause of the present disasters is policy, not administration, and Downing St. is responsible for policy. The question of administration

2 The Ds would stay at Webb’s Royal Hotel at Torquay 4-19 November, for which the bill would be

£34.19.7. H acc.

1 Lennox had written from Gordon Castle on 2 November: ‘I have to address my Constituents about India
next Monday. Would you most kindly let me have one line to Portland Place, just to say, if I ought to
attack the H.E.I.C. or what line I ought to take.’ On the 5th he had repeated the request, having
learned D was at Torquay: *... I wrote to you at Hughenden ... because I fancied that, you might wish to
throw out, some “feeler” about India, without compromising yourself, & see, how it would take.’
H B/XX/LX/93, 96.

2 See 2975&n4. The second article in the Press of this day (7 November) had similarly focused on cabinet
members ‘casting about for a scapegoat on to which to lay the burden of their sins’, contending that,
although ‘the double Government has been the curse of India’, eliminating it would not ‘absolve the
Ministers from the consequences of their own personal acts.’ Palmerston was most particularly castigated
for his misdeeds, including that ‘he joined in defeating the motion for further inquiry, before renewal
[of the EIC charter], that Lord Stanley, on behalf of the Conservative party, made.’

will arise, when that of policy is settled. The policy should be first censured, and
if Parliament sanctions such a course, the censurers will be responsible for the
construction of a new administrative system.
This is a hurried, as far as expression, but, I believe, a just view of the situation.

EDITORIAL COMMENT: The following is the text in Rathborne’s edition, with two typographical errors
here corrected as shown.

MY DEAR COLONEL, Royal Hotel, Torquay, November 9th, 1857.
I read your article in the New Quarterly,' on my way down here, with the utmost

1 Drummond in his 3 November 1857 letter inviting the Ds to visit some time after the 11th had added:
‘You must have done shooting over the heads of chawbacons [te yokels| before that.’ H B/XXI/D/385. D’s
last county speech of the season had been given at Amersham on Tuesday 27 October, while Drummond
had given a speech on 30 October at the anniversary dinner of the Dorking Agricultural Association.
In it he had made several joking remarks, concluding: ‘Houses must be warmed ~— not that I believe any
person in this or any other wood county buys fuel, because they can steal it. (Laughter.) They have only
to step over a hedge into any person’s field, and they can find as much as they like; and of course any
person living in a wood country [stc] would be a fool to buy any fuel when he could get it for nothing.
(Laughter.)’ BH (31 Oct, 7 Nov 1857).

2 Lovaine was Drummond’s son-in-law.

1 For the New Quarterly see 2974&n1 and app | 1366xn1. In his ‘Observations’ at the end of the 4-page
pamphlet (see ph) in which he reprinted D’s letters to him, Rathborne refers to his ‘services, as a writer
on Indian affairs, for the Conservative party, — services, I may add, which, whether in the Press, or in the
New Quarterly Review, were from first to last entirely gratuitous.’ He then refers specifically to ‘the article
in the New Quarterly, for November, 1857, headed The Indian Revolt’ as the occasion for the above letter
from D. ‘The Indian Revolt, Its Causes and its Cure’ (New Quarterly Review VI (1857) 463-76) was a review
of Ellenborough’s addresses on India in 1857, of D’s speeches on India of 27 July and 11 August 1857,
of the Press since 1854, and of three books on the Indian Mutiny; rehearsing Whig policy on India and
its disastrous effects, it argued that ‘different indeed might be the present state of India had [Ellen

gratification; not merely, I hope, or even principally, because you have spoken so
kindly of my efforts; but, because I feel persuaded, that a general and elaborate
view, of the question in the form there presented, will greatly aid, and enforce,
those more frequent lucubrations which I so much admire, and which, I think,
have produced a beneficial effect on public opinion. I thought your remarks,
yesterday, admirable, and you just hit the nail on the head.” The government, [as]
well as the Company, must be greatly perplexed; the Times is frantic, and proves
their alarm. I should think the financial question will bring affairs to a crisis.

It seems to me — but I jot down these remarks with sincere deference to your
judgment, — that the Indian question has two aspects, one of administration, the
other of policy. For the first, the Company is respo[n]sible; for the last, Downing
Street. The administration of India has been long condemned; and though the
immediate disasters have been brought about by the policy, still, advantage should
be taken of the emergency, to effect those changes in the administration which are
required.

The position is this. If Parliament took the constitutional course, it would first
censure the policy; and then, if the censure was successful, they should undertake
a reconstruction of the administration.

I write in a room full of people, but hope I am not very obscure.

Ever yours sincerely, | D.

the features of the 1858 India Bill.
2 See 2991n2 for Rathborne’s Press article of Saturday that D in Torquay would have seen ‘yesterday’.

Possibly this has to do with D’s efforts regarding SBW’s coat-of-arms; see 33768&n2. The Guildhall at
Exeter contained the coats-of-arms of the benefactors of Devon. Murray's Handbook for Devon and Cornwall
(1859) 20-1.

if you have an opportunity let them know that I dont imagine any newspaper account, judging by the
one I have seen, gave at all an adequate notion of his success — & success of the most solid description.’
Evidently MA had sent it to Lady Derby, who on 12 November had returned it with many thanks: ‘It
is extremely gratifying and gave me much pleasure, as you may imagine.’ The envelope (postmarked
13 November in London) is docketed ‘autograph’ by SBW. H D/III/C/2567,a.

ORIGINAL: PS 697
PUBLICATION HISTORY: M&B IV 102-4, dated at Torquay 18 November 1857, to Lord Derby

Our party is pledged against the Bank Charter Act by the course pursued by them
in 1847, and also by the standing policy of the country gentlemen, which is adverse
to a restricted currency. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the present Act has nothing
to do with the existing state of affairs, and had it not been in force, a crisis equally
disastrous would probably have occurred, and we should have been driven to £1
notes, as in 1825,

3 During this stay at Torquay D received telegrams on 13 and 15 November, from Haydon and Lennox
respectively. The former read: ‘Parliament expected to meet in a fortnight. Calcutta Mail in. Havelock’s
position at Lucknow most critical, he is surrounded by rebels. Outram telegraphs to Calcutta for
powerful reinforcements, proposes to cut his way back to Cawnpore leaving the Garrison at Lucknow
reinforced.’ The latter read: ‘Outram declares himself unable two [sic] leave Lucknow, Colin says to [sic]
Brigades insufficient to relieve. Transport, commisariat [stc] deficient at Calcutta. Authoritative.” RTC
[315Q 316Q].

4 In the wake of another assassination attempt on Napoleon Il, for which several Italians with connections
to refugees in London had been convicted in August, and the mid-October discovery on Waterloo
Bridge of a dismembered and headless body, thought to be that of a foreigner, a person signing himself
Captain Edward Gleig of the 92nd Highlanders (presumably the Charles Edward Stuart Gleig, (1825c1906), army officer, in Wellesley Index v 300) had sent D an assassination warning. On 30 November he
replied to D's acknowledgement (not found) of a subsequent packet of papers delivered to Grosvenor
Gate while Gleig was ill, *... duty compels me to say that I had reason for warning you against assassination, though no doubt my imagination has been my chief light as to that source of anxiety ... I do not
now see the extraordinary number of foreigners that I saw about London at the time I wrote ... Should
you see me — you will distinguish, as I do, between the Induction which has led to my opinion as to the
designs of Napoleon; — the impression which has led to the conception of a POSSIBLE PLOT; and the Supernatural Expenences which | had during my illness ... Further, should I observe an unusual number of
foreigners in London tomorrow or next day, I shall press for an interview.’ Gleig, who in December 1854
had sent D a plan for the conquest of the Crimea and on 18 April 1857 acknowledged receiving a note
from D (not found), would send D similar warnings over the next 15 years. AR (1857 Chronicle) 147-8,
194-7; H B/XXI/G/143, 146-65. Because the material D is enclosing has not been found, it is not clear
whether D was the intended target; by coincidence, Manchester on this day (14 November) was writing
to D from Compiégne about assassination: ‘The Emperor has just told me ... that today a meeting (he
thinks a public meeting) of refugees and Chartists was held in London, and that those present came
unanimously to a resolution to assassinate the Emperor ...’ H B/XXI/M/ 122.

Principally because of a financial disaster. in the U.S. there had been a severe drain of bullion reserves
and a mounting financial crisis, with several banks stopping payments. On 12 November the government
had authorized the Bank of England to exceed the limit of their currency circulation as set by the Bank
Charter Act of 1844 and to issue notes to any amount at a discount rate of at least 10 percent, and had
further eased the panic by promising to summon parliament in early December. The panic quickly
passed. AR (1857 Chronicle) 217-21; Sir John Clapham An Economic History of Modern Britain 1. (Cambridge 1967) 367-9. For the similar crisis in 1847 see IV 1602n4, 1608n3, 1609ni, V 1627n1, 1636n8,
1651n1 and 2054&nn1&2. Derby, in anticipation of the imminent meeting of parliament, had written
from Knowsley on 15 November: ‘I presume that the principal object of the Government will be to

I doubt the expediency of fixing upon any particular rate of interest as the
period of interposition, and, indeed, I question the propriety of the power of
suspension in anybody being recognised. We should, I venture to think, support
the policy advocated in 1847 — 2.¢., a recurrence to the state of things existing
before the Act of 1844, which we then held as aggravating evils at periods inevitable
in a country of great commercial transactions.”

The suspension of the Act by the present Government I look upon as rather
pitiful, and I think, with their opinions, they ought to have been firm. The suspension by our friends, if they had been in office, would have been a consistent and,
in their views, a beneficial course. The present state of affairs is a triumph for the
opinions advocated by Ld. G. Bentinck and Mr. Thomas Baring in 1848.

If by any chance you have a copy of G.B.’s biography at hand, you will find some
curious details, which may be of use at this moment, regarding that similar
period.®

I believe, if the Government had been firm, and that all the joint stock banks
and the re-discounters of Lombard Street had suspended payment, which they
would infallibly have done, that with the present produce of the mines you would
have had money at 2 per ct. this time next year, and for an enduring period. This
would have been much better for the country gentlemen than an inflated currency,
but, without knowing it, they always play the game of the commercial gamblers.

I think the position taken up generally by our friends, that the currency of the
country ought to expand with the commerce of the country, and that what might
have been expedient in 1844 is not suited to 1857, is a fallacy. Currency always does
expand with the commerce of the country. Bank notes are a very small portion of
the currency of the country. That is represented mainly by bills of exchange, which
always necessarily bear a due relation to the commercial transactions.‘

obtain an Act of Indemnity about which we shall of course make no difficulty ... [but] it will not be in
their power to confine Parliament to the discussion of the Act of Indemnity, nor even to the Act of
1844, which, in its integrity, I think it will be impossible after two failures to uphold ... I am disposed
to adhere to the principle of the Act, so far as to secure the practical convertibility of the note, and to
prevent its depreciation under any circumstances; but I own I never understood the ground on which
Pee] took his £14,000,000 as the limit of excess of issues over Bullion, and I have long been of opinion
that that limit might safely be exceeded ... What would be, in your judgment, the effect of such a
permissive power, limited by the rate of discount, that rate being fixed so high as to preclude its exercise
under any ordinary circumstances, and only rendering it available against the effect of panic? ... Let me
hear from you soon, and fully.’ On 16 November Derby had written again: ‘I wrote you a long letter
yesterday, which has crossed yours to me, and which I hope you have received.’ H B/XX/S/150-1. In late
1825, when the South American gold-mine bubble burst, a desperate run to exchange currency into gold
had precipitated a financial crisis resolved at the last minute (the Bank of England cash reserve was
down to £18,000) by an issue of £1 and £2 banknotes. Peter Wilsher The Pound in Your Pocket 1870-1970
(1970) 22.

2 D would repeat this charge in his speech in the House on 4 December. Hansard CXLVIII cols 214-25.

3 The 1847 crisis is the main subject of chapter 21 of LGB, the 1848 committee on the matter is discussed
throughout chapter 23. Derby on 24 November replied from Knowsley that his copy of LGB was at St
James's Square, but he had asked Stanley to send it to him. H B/XX/S/152. On 10 May 1847, Baring had
been critical of the 1844 Bank Charter Act and Bentinck had called for its repeal; on 30 November 1848,
Baring had attributed the commercial distress to ‘the reckless over-trading of commercial men.’ Hansard
XCII cols 618-27, 633-8, XCV cols 436-46.

4 Haydon had written on 16 November to suggest that a definite line be taken: ‘... the question is whether

94

EBSCOhost - printed on 3/12/2021 3:18 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN. All use subject to https://www.ebsco.com/terms-of-use
Peel’s limit of 14 mill. was fixed, if I am not mistaken, upon returns, which
proved that under no circumstances of pressure had the Bank circulation been
reduced to that amount, which described also the amount of the Government debt
to the Bank.

After all, what is wanted now is not currency, but capital.

There is, however, one subject of speculation the interest of which, at this
moment, cannot be too highly imagined. What light does the present monetary
condition of the country throw upon those vast returns of exports and imports
which have been so ostentatiously paraded before us during the last seven years,
accompanied by simultaneous assurances that trade was never in so healthy a state?

I agree with you entirely that we must not permit the impending session to be
a merely monetary campaign.” The whole policy of the Government must be
opened — but tho’ there are for the Cabinet, at the present moment, many points
of difficulty, in Parliament all will be merged in that of India....

I ventured in the H. of C. in the month of July to lay down that no measure would
be efficacious unless we first ascertained the cause of the outbreak, and I staked my
opinion that the paramount and proximate cause was to be found in the annexation
of Oude. The Government expressed their astonishment at the bare suspicion of such
a cause, and distinctly gave it as their opinion that Oude had nothing to do with the
affair.° At present it is generally held that my statement was justified.

But what has been the consequence of the Government attempting to quell a
rebellion, of the cause of which they were not cognisant?

The insurrection in Oude cut off all their communications with the Upper
Provinces. They have never been able to send a man to Delhi from the Metropolis.
Had they recognised the annexation as the prime cause, acting, of course, on
discontented materials long brooding, they might have sent troops early in the year
overland, perhaps, to Bombay, forwarded them up the Indus, and through countries where camels abound; descended on Delhi, then on Oude, and prevented all
the disasters that have occurred and the still existing dangers. At present, having
assumed an erroneous basis for their operations, there seems a chance of the
blunders of the Crimea being repeated on a larger scale — for the means of transport from Calcutta are very deficient, and we may find that we have a large army
at the capital and none in the provinces.

I think on the first night the Indian case ought to be opened in both Houses.’

a Currency Act of 1844 is in detail applicable to the circumstances of Commerce in 1857?’ H
B/XXI/H/ 342.

5 Derby on the 15th (n1) had written: ‘I did not however intend to enter on a discussion of the Act of
1844, but to ask for your opinion as to the course which we ought to pursue when Parliament meets.
1 think, as I said before, that it will be impossible, and that it would not be desirable, to confine its
attention to the Currency question. We must have a Queen’s Speech, and the whole policy of the
Government, foreign and domestic, must be laid before us ... I own I think myself that we have arrived
at a stage in Indian affairs in which we have a full right to enquiry both as to the past and the future,
and when, without laying ourselves open to any imputation of faction, we may fairly challenge the
Government to vindicate the measures they have adopted in the East, including the forgotten China!’

My dear J,

We arrived here last night from Devon, & at four o’ck go to Hatfield — & there are
other engagements, wh: will prevent my being here permanently until the 25th. I
cannot disembarass myself of them. I am sorry I must declinee the pleasure of

that I must remain in town. I am quite sure yr circular lost nothing by my absence,
but was marked with yr. usual tact & good judgmt.'

8 In his reply (n3), the twentieth letter he had written that day, Derby agreed ‘that an hours conversation
is worth all the letters in the World. — but I do not understand that our party is pledged (and certainly
I am not) to the restoration of the state of things which existed previously to the passing of Peel’s Act
in 1844; and my opinion is that if we attempt such a change, we shall be signally defeated ... I should
be glad to hear you work out your opinion that if the Government had stood firm ... money would have
been at 2 pr. Cent this time next year. I confess I cannot trace the process ... How far [Peel’s] restrictions may be modified, safely and usefully, is I think the question we have to consider; and it is impossible to conceive one of greater weight. You raise another however of almost equal importance when you
ask how is it that with the enormous increase of Imports and Exports ... we are reduced to our present
condition of panic and distress. If the premises are true, the inference is inevitable, that our monetary
system must be wrong.’

I am not satisfied with what is doing about the M. Herald. I did not like the
confid[entia]] circular, & meant to have spoken to Rose fully about it.

The M. Herald continues to / be the worst morning paper in the country. Its
articles are the poorest; its reporting the most inaccurate & imperfect; its pretended news quite contemptible.

All this is occasioned by the niggardly spirit in wh: it is conducted. I have heard
from authority, that they give the writer of a leading article / one guinea! This is
the pay of a penny a liner. When it assumed to set up as the recognised organ of
a party, it ought not to have had less than three first rate writers +l (irrespective of
Editors) paid at the rate of twenty guineas pr week, & expected to furnish only
three articles pr week. This item / wd be about 3000£ pr annm:

The staff of Reporters of the Herald consists of the refuse of the Gallery. They
have no single source of first rate information, & their correspondents, such as they
are, are the laughing stock of Europe.

This distressing & disgusting state of affairs has been brought about / by the
man Johnston, who is an impostor, pretending to be a capitalist, when he has very
little money at command, & that, I believe, not his own.”

The thing is worse than it was before, to this extent: that, before, it had sunk
into oblivion, & now the trumpets have been sounded, public / attention has been
solicited, &, to a certain degree, attracted; & a golden opportunity has been lost,
& lost for ever.

Powerful writing & vigorous organisation, at the beginning of this year, might
have floated the craft. [t resembles the Leviathan only in being irremediably in the
mud. /

You are now trying to get money, to allow the man Johnstone to continue his
peddling trade. A real capitalist would have only required the sanction of a party:

a draft of a circular (evidently about the upcoming session) to Derby for approval. He was expecting
Hamilton, Rose and possibly Malmesbury on the 28th, and asked the Ds to join them. H B/XX/J/47.

hope that others will do the same, so that we may really have a great improvement. At any rate Hamilton Rose & Taylor Naas & others are greatly satisfied that something has been done.’ There is a draft
of the circular (see 2955n2) marked ‘Confidential and dated 17 June 1857 at the Carlton: ‘We have much
satisfaction in informing you that the Morning Herald newspaper has been bought in the Conservative
interest ... and that it is likely to be conducted with a degree of spirit and intelligence calculated to
render it the effective organ of sound Conservative principles’. The circular, presumably sent to all party

EDITORIAL COMMENT: There is no salutation. Sic: Stewart; Rothersay; Lytton Bulwer.

Hatfield House | Nov. 23. 1857
We came down here in the same carriage as Lady Stuart de Rothesay, the mother
of Lady Canning.’ She was, as usual, very agreeable & chatty, & told / us endless
tales of Calcutta, & all the adventures of this perilous crisis.

One thing, she said, particularly amused me. She was very indignant at a statement, made in Exeter Hall by Lord Shaftesbury, that mut mutilated / English
women were constantly arriving at Calcutta, & that he had read in a letter of Lady
Canning, that there were more than thirteen English ladies with their noses cut off
at that moment at the Presidency. Lady Stewart said, that there was / not the
slightest authority for this statement of Lord Shaftesbury, & that Lady Canning had
never alluded to the subject in any letter.’

5 Jolliffe on 28 November would write that the part of D’s letter about the newspaper had caused him
‘some anxiety & surprise ... I have been following the urgent advice of Rose and Hamilton, who I
thought where [sic] your own particular men, & would be sure to be following out your views[.] I grieve
to think, that this is not the case, but we must make the best of it, and even if it is f[ro]m some
misunderstanding that this Mr. Johnstone is likely now to have the necessary means at his command,
we must endeavour to make use of him as we best may, & as the only chance we have; and trust to Rose
to make such arrangements as may place him under the most complete control.’ H B/XxX/J/48.

Lord Canning, since February 1856 governor-general of India, in 1835 had married Charlotte Stuart
(1817-1861), eldest daughter of the Dowager Lady Stuart de Rothesay (1789-1867) and her late husband,
ist Baron Stuart de Rothesay, whom she as Lady Elizabeth Yorke had married in 1816,

2 Lord Shaftesbury on 30 October at the New Town Hall, Wimborne, had addressed a meeting in aid of
the relief fund for the Indian mutiny sufferers (established 25 August by the Lord Mayor of London,
with the Ladies’ Committee meeting every Tuesday at the Mansion House from ten to one): ‘... I tell
you that I myself saw a letter from the highest lady now in India stating that day by day ladies were
coming into Calcutta with their ears and their noses cut off and their eyes put out ...’ By February 1858
a total of £342,929 was raised. AR (1857 Chronicle) 166-8; The Times (2, 4 Nov 1857). An example of Lady
Canning’s actual reports is quoted in Hibbert 213: ‘“A child who was said to have been killed slowly, bit
by bit cut off, was certainly killed at once with a tulwar, and so it is in each place ... People on the spot

In consequence of this statement of Lord Shaftesbury, a surgeon wrote to the
Ladies Committee for the Relief of the Indian Sufferers, of / wh: Lady Stuart de
Rothersay is a member, stating that he had great experience in the formation of
artificial noses, that he was ready to give all his skill, time, & devotion to the cause,
but as the machinery was rather expensive, he hoped, in accepting his services, the
Committee wd. defray the prime / cost of the springs! He then gave a tariff of
prices, & offered to supply noses for English ladies by the dozen, &, I believe, even
by the gross.

We were rather in hopes, that Lady Stuart was coming on here, but found she
was about to pay a visit to her mother, the Dowager Lady / Hardwicke, who lives
at Tittenhanger, about four miles from Hatfield, & who is now in good health &
in her 95th. year.”

This Elizabethan palace covers three acres of ground, but is in a state of perfect
repair, &, within, is as comfortable, as well aired & as tight & light, as any English
gentleman’s more moderate / & modern residence.

The guests here are Lord & Lady De La Warr the parents of our hostess, & their
her sister, Lady Arabelia West.’ Lord Chelsea,’ Lord & Lady Lovaine, whose father
Lord Beverley’ is an habitué of Torquay. Lady Cowley the wife of the late, & the
mother of the present, ambassador, / & Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer: all agreeable
people, but the most charming persons are the children, four or five fairies of both
sexes — the prettiest, the funniest, & the most graceful urchins you could fancy of infinite grace & merriment, dressed in the most fantastic costume & singing,
laughing, & tumbling / the whole day. There is a little girl, who is only two years
old, a Lady Margaret,’ who goes thro’ her manual exercise, wh: she learns from
a militia sergeant, & then, by way of divertisement, imitates the master of the band
keeping time to his musicians, with a trilling voice & a faultless [zllegible deletion]
ear, & waving, with arch solemnity, all / the time, a paper knife, or a stick of
sealing wax.

say the stories going about are not true of that place but happened elsewhere, and so on. Those who
have gone from place to place never find evidence of the horrible treatment everyone here believes.
Only the massacres are really certain.”’ See also Greville’s similar account (Vil 316) of Lady Canning’s
reports; he also observed: ‘Shaftesbury ... does his utmost to make the case out to be as bad as possible
and to excite the rage and indignation of the masses to the highest pitch ...” Cf D’s views on atrocity
reports in 29648nn4&6.

3 Lady Stuart de Rothesay’s elderly mother was the Dowager Lady Hardwicke (1763-1858), who in 1782
as Lady Elizabeth Lindsay, only daughter of 5th Earl of Balcarres, had married 3rd Earl of Hardwicke.
Tittenhanger Park and Hatfield House are near St Albans, Herts.

4 Lady Arabella Diana Sackville West (1835-1869), the De La Warrs’ youngest daughter (Lady Salisbury
was their second), in 1860 would marry Sir Alexander Bannerman, 9th Bt.

5 Henry Charles Cadogan (1812-1873), Viscount Chelsea, eldest son of 3rd Earl Cadogan, whom he would
succeed as 4th Earl in 1864; col Royal Westminster Middlesex Militia 1841; Conservative MP for Reading
1841-7, for Dover 1852-7; PC 1866; captain of the yeomen of the guard 1866-8.

6 George Percy (1778-1867), 2nd Earl of Beverley, was Lovaine’s father; he would succeed his cousin as
5th Duke of Northumberland in 1865; he was MP for Beeralston 1799-1830, a lord of the treasury 1804-6,
captain of the yeomen of the guard 1842-6.

PUBLICATION HISTORY: M&B IV 104, dated at the Carlton Club, Friday 27 November 1857, part of the
first paragraph

EDITORIAL COMMENT: Paper imprinted ‘Carlton Club’. Endorsed in another hand on the eighth page:
‘Disraeli B.’ Sic: Ellenbro’s; St James’ Square.

The Rt Honble | The Earl of Derby Friday. 27. 57
My dear Lord,
I return you Lord Ellenbro’s letter. After the announcement in the “Times” of this
morning, I see no use / in any attempt to confer with him. I apprehend any unnecessary declaration agst the Company, at this moment, would be extremely impolitic.
Whatever the faults of / the “double Governmt”, the causes of the present calamities
in India are attributable to the policy of the Cabinet. Who annexed Oude? Who sent
the soldiers in / sailing vessels? Who scornfully neglected the overland passage?’
Besides Lord E’s letter, I enclose another, from a still greater personage. In our
forlorn condition, it shd. be some source of solace, that so distinguished a /
statesman condescends to co-operate with us.”

2 Baring had replied to D's summons (not found, but see 2999) on 25 November 1857: ‘I will take my
chance of finding you at Grosvenor Gate tomorrow afternoon between 6 & 7 oclock ...’ H B/XXI/B/54.
The Times on 20 November had announced: ‘A large blue-book, issued yesterday from the printers, forms
an appendix and index to the report from the select committee of the House of Commons on the Bank
Charter Act ... [in] 500 pages.’

3 See 29978&nn1-3,5; Jolliffe seems from his letter of 28 November to have been unaware that D expected
to see him on the 26th in London. Hamilton’s last letter to D was the one of 24 September; see 2957n1.

In his 15 November letter (see 2995nn1&5), Derby had mentioned writing to Ellenborough (governorgeneral of India 1841-4) for his views on India and had promised D the result. On 24 November (see
2995&nn3&8) he had enclosed Ellenborough’s subsequent ‘note’ which gave ‘some insight into his
Indian views,’ but did ‘not promise much in the way of consultation and cooperation.’ Another letter
received from him that day (the 24th) looked ‘better’, and Derby suggested D call on him on Sunday
or Monday morning ‘and obtain a fuller insight into his opinions and intentions. It is very desirable,
if possible, to have him with us on this question. The Calcutta Petition [see 2970&n2] makes out a
damaging case against the Government.’ The Times on this day (the 27th) in its first leader blamed the
East India directors more than the government for the slowness of getting troops to India: “The double
Government, which is the type of obstruction and circumlocution, has had its day ...’ However, in
another leader, it remarked on the latest despatches: “We hear of no commissariat difficulties, no
“requisitions,” no embarrassments of system, no complications of routine ... everything is done promptly,
dexterously, and triumphantly. It is only natural ... that the suspended functions of the Indian administration, and especially the collection of its dues, should now be brought again into action.’ Cf2987&n2.
Ellenborough on 3 December would support Derby in the Lords by arguing that this was not an
opportune time to discuss the system of government of India, and by focusing on the government's
breaking of its promise in May to send troops expeditiously. Hansard CXLVIII cols 65-7.

Tom Baring called on me yesterday evening, &, this morning, I called on Rothschild. I went into the monetary question fully with both.’

Time is very valuable, as / there are a great many people to see, & much to
digest. I shd. like, therefore, to know, as soon as convenient, when you wish me to
call in St James’ Square. If Tuesday, I shd. hike it, if / possible, not to be before
four o’ck, as the morning is the only time I can command, & that not always, &
from the enclosed, it wd. seem, that Wednesday must be wasted.‘

My dear H.,
I have not a moment, and shall not leave this till late.

strategy and had drawn up a list; the first item was that ‘we ought to have a conference (Cabinet, not
H. of C. only) on Wednesday 2nd: on the whole state of affairs, & our line of action as a party.’ The
others were support for the indemnity bill, resistance to reform and legislative action on India; they were
not agreed on attacking Canning as an individual. Pakington also thought the party should decide for
itself ‘what the future Govt. of India ought to be.’ H B/XX/P/35. Evidently D did not appreciate
Pakington’s assumption of the role of ‘so distinguished a statesman’, but Derby at Knowsley on the 29th
(n4) merely ignored it: ‘I return the letter enclcsed in yours of the 27th.’

3 Lennox had written to D on ‘Saturday’: ‘I saw Rothschild to day; He regrets the Bank Charter suspension; He says the Crisis is owing to the large Brokers; and to the system of hoarding, which has become
general, particularly among the farmers & all over Europe. He said, that, had it not been suspended;
there would have been a general stoppage which would have destroyed these great Bankers and proved,
an ultimate benefit to the Country.’ H B/XX/LX/109.

4 Derby replied on the 29th: ‘I am very desirous, if possible, of seeing you before I see any of our friends,
but as Pakington is to call on me sometime on Tuesday, and Walpole at 2 on that day, I do not see how
I can do so, unless you can come to me tomorrow Evening — or, better still, if you will come and take
a Bachelor dinner with me at 7.30 ... We really ought thoroughly to understand each other before I
undertake to advise others ...’ H B/XX/S8/153. In the event, D fell ill on this day (27 November); see 3005
and 3006.

—

Rathborne (ph) adds a note: *N.B.- On Mr. Disraeli’s return to town, the “Sunday Chats” were resumed,
which are alluded to by him in his first letter, — that is, the conversations which took place with him at
his house every Sunday when he was in town, during visits made by me to him, at his request, for that
purpose.’ See 2960&n1. 27 November is the first Friday after D’s return to town in late 1857; perhaps
he wrote this before falling ill later in the day (see 3006).

replying that he hoped Goltz would continue his efforts ““to maintain between the two countries that

4 During the Civil War, the Confederacy had contracted British boatyards to build warships, among them
the Florida, Georgia, Rappahannock, Shenandoah and, most famously, the Alabama (launched July 1862,
sunk June 1864), all of them serving as Confederate commerce raiders and sinking more than 150 Union
ships (68 by the Alabama). Arguing that Britain had violated its proclamation of neutrality — issued in
May 1861, the war having begun in April — the U.S. sought damages, the so-called Alabama claims. The
Treaty of Washington (8 May 1871) would establish an international arbitration commission (Sir John
A. Macdonald was one of the six British delegates) to evaluate the merit of the American claims. In
September 1872, the commission would order Britain to pay the U.S. $15.5 million in damages, Britain
expressing official regret (but admitting no guilt) for the destruction inflicted by British-built warships.

Confidential

Right Honorable | The Earl of Mayo Jan. 3 1868
My dear Mayo,

I saw ArchBp Manning last Saturday: he called on me & read me (did not show me)
portions of a letter from Cardinal Cullen, from wh: I inferred, that there would / be

7 William Lockyer Merewether (1825-1880), cB 1860 and kcs1 1868 (24 August), had had a distinguished
military and administrative career in India. He had been military secretary to the government of Bombay
1861, political agent at Aden 1863-7 and, as lieut-col, had headed the pioneer force dispatched from
Bombay on 21 September 1867 against King Tewodros 11 of Abyssinia (see Ix 4521n4). Lieut-gen Sir Robert Napier, commander-in-chief at Bombay, had been assigned to command the Abyssinian expedition
on 30 August 1867. See 4668n2.

8 Derby would reply from Knowsley on 3 January with a letter marked ‘Private’: ‘But for the confidence I
have in your judgment, I own I could not take so sanguine a view as you do of the state of our finances.
Comparing the receipts, up to the present time, not with those of last year, but with your Estimates, I find
a deficiency of £800,000 instead of £300,000 on which you had calculated (of course without reference
to the increased Income Tax) and I do not see on what grounds you calculate on this deficiency being
made up during the next quarter. I need not say I hope your expectations will not be disappointed.
There are some indications of a revival of trade in this part of the world; but the Fenian “scare” stands
in the way of any renewal of confidence. On the other hand it is exciting the loyal population to fever
heat, and it is to be feared that it may lead to an indiscriminate proscription of all Irish R. Catholics. You
saw the account of the attempt to blow up the gas works at Warrington. An Irish Priest is trying to make
out that it was all a hoax; but all the R. Catholic workmen have been dismissed; and one of the managers
was imprudent enough to tell the Priest that they were so dismissed on account of their Religion! Four
Irish Workmen (Protestants) have been kept on. This spirit is not likely to be pacified by such documents
as that lately put forth by the R.C. Clergy of Limerick, which I should have thought exposed the writer
to a prosecution for sedition, if there were any chance in the South of Ireland of convicting a Priest. In
England the feeling is so strong that I believe we shall have to resist a popular pressure for ultra-constitutional measures of repression as applied to this Country as well as Ireland. I do not wonder, under
these circumstances at home, at Stanley’s anxiety about our relations with America. Where all turns in
the amount of weight which the Irish vote can carry with unscrupulous Politicians, and in the presence
of internal difficulties to which a foreign war might make a division, it is impossible not to feel somewhat
anxious as to the result. I quite agree with you as to the unsatisfactory state of Foreign Affairs in Europe.
The Emperor’s embarrassments are serious; and he has evidently lost much of the nerve and obeisance
which formerly carried him through; and his prestige in France is diminished accordingly. Our danger
would be much greater if it were not for the impecuniosity of all the powers except Prussia — and, after
all, of Russia, whose intrigues are increasing. I hope however that we have hitherto been able to thwart
them, and, on the whole, to turn in our favour the balance of the vacillating counsels of France in regard
to Eastern affairs. In spite of some drawbacks, I look hopefully on our Abyssinian business; and by this
time I hope Napier may have landed, and that he will push to the front as speedily as possible. If we could
meet Parliament with tidings of success!! I reciprocate, very cordially, your good wishes for the New Year.
May it be to you productive of less anxiety, public and private, than that which has just passed away!’ H

EDITORIAL COMMENT: From a typescript.

Right Honorable Mr. Sec: Hardy." Grosvenor Gate, Jan. 4. ’68.
My dear Hardy,

I am greatly annoyed, that, in addition to all your thought and care, you should
have the vexation, at such a moment, of not being properly supported by the other
offices.

I won't attempt, now, to guess the offenders: but I wish to say, that, among the
principal reasons why I remain in town is, that, if necessary, I should be of service
to you.

You are placed in a proud, but most trying, position, to which I, for one, believe
you completely equal; but it is intolerable, that, in addition to your almost isolated
state ata moment when you ought to have the advantage of full council, you should
experience the disadvantage of not having all our resources at your command.

I will call on you to-morrow, at three o’clock, unless I hear to the contrary.*
Yours, D.

Right Honorable | The Earl of Derby | K. G.

My dear Lord,

I must recall to your recollection the case of Mr Watkin, M.P., who was to have been
knighted last year."

It was asserted, at the time, & I believe not without some foundation, that the
Duke of Newcastle had promised this gentleman, for certain services rendered to
the Government in the International Col: Railway of / Canada, that, when the contemplated honors, in respect to that undertaking, were distributed, he shd. be remembered.

I made the hitch in that contemplated Colonial distribution last year, the plausible & honorable ground on wh: Mr Watkin’s distinction was deferred.

Hardy on this day (4th) had written to p from the home office a letter docketed ‘4 Jany 1868’: ‘I enclose
a telegram just received — Police Soldiers & every provocation to vigilance do not seem to save Cork from
fillibusters [sc]. Gt. Britain does not send me any news of importance to day but there may be very important things for I found yesterday that compulsion is required to draw forth some from departments
wh. ought to supply it spontaneously.’ The telegram, dated 4 January 1868 and addressed to ‘Supt Kettle,
Scotland Yard’, reads: “Cork Saturday. a powder magazine at Lough a suburb of Cork. Robbed last night
of ten hundred weight of gunpowder magazine belonged to Mr Murray, Cork.’ H B/Xx/HA/20, 20a.
Hardy on the 6th would record: “Saturday ... At H.O. pretty late but evg quiet. A good deal of bother
about the unaccountable negligence of Millbank [Prison] and Police ... yesterday ... Disraeli came in the
afternoon & kept me. I had a good deal to do & was twice called up in the night, rather trying’. Hardy

The Gazette has recently notified the satisfactory settkement of these Colonial
claims, & Mr Watkin has turned up again, & accordingly.

It is of importance, that his claim / shd be gratified.

There never were really any imsp insuperable, scarcely any valid, objections to
conferring the honor last year as the finding of the Committee in the Yarmouth
election exonerated Watkin personally from all responsibility,*? but, at the moment,
it was discreet not to obtrude tke his distinction.

With regard to the general position of Mr Watkin, he is Chairman of one of the
great Railways, & so high / is his reputation in such matters, that since the crash in
that property,? he has, I understand, been requested to become Director im of three
other principal Railway Companies with a view to profit by his counsel & experience:* notably, within a few days, he consented to become a Director of the Great
Eastern,° in order that he might assist “his noble friend”, Lord Cranborne, another
of the new directors, until “his noble friend” assured the chairmanship of the undertaking.

There / would be no captious notice of this distinction from below the opposition gangway, for Mr Watkin sits there, & has numerous & powerful relations on
those benches:

there wo[ul]d be no notice from the Opposition proper, for Mr Watkin is an independent, but avowed, follower of Mr Gladstone:

there wd. be no notice from the malcontents on our side, for Lord Cranborne is,
as I hear, Mr. Watkin’s most intimate confederate.

I / earnestly request, & advise, you to comply with Mr Watkin’s request wishes.°

Yrs sincerely, | D.

2 Watkin had been returned as mp (L) for Great Yarmouth in March 1857 but unseated on petition in
August. In February 1867 an inquiry commission had issued a report on corrupt practices at the Great
Yarmouth elections of 1857, 1859 and 1865. Although it found no corruption in August 1857, it determined that the 1859 election had been ‘““conducted by and on behalf of Mr. Edward William Watkin and
Mr. Adolphus William Young in a corrupt and illegal manner”’, both men allegedly bribing electors. The
Times (25 Feb 1867). Great Yarmouth had been disfranchised for corruption by the Reform Act 1867.

3 See rx 4495&nn1-4. The Times on 1 January 1867 had reported that the London, Chatham, and Dover
Railway Company ‘can neither pay interest to its creditors nor dividends to its share-holders; and that the
whole concern ... is in Chancery.’

4 Watkin held prominent positions in numerous railway companies, among them the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada (president 1861), Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway Company (chairman
1864), South Eastern Railway Company (chairman 1866) and Great Western Railway (director 1866).

5 Ata general meeting of the proprietors of the Great Eastern Railway on 3 January, it had been resolved
that Cranborne, George Wodehouse Currie, Richard Young, James Chadwick, Robert Stuart and Watkin
be elected directors. The Times (4 Jan 1867).

6 Derby would reply from Knowsley on 7 January with a letter headed ‘Confidential: ‘I trust I need not assure you how unwilling I am even to hesitate about acting upon any wish or recommendation of yours;
but with regard to Mr. Watkin, although undoubtedly the Honor of Knighthood is not a very great one,
I cannot forget that last year, when it was reported to be about to be conferred upon him, the Duke of
Buckingham expressed an earnest hope that there was no truth in the report, adding that if there were,
the Colonial Office would be up in arms; and from what he said I inferred that there was evidence there
of a nature so damaging to his character, that it would be most imprudent to bring his name prominently
before the public (with no reference at all to the Yarmouth affair). I must therefore beg of you to let me
suspend any decision till I come up to Town, in less than a fortnight, when I can make farther enquiries,
and talk the matter over with you and the Duke. I am afraid Rolt’s attack is likely to give us another high
legal office to dispose of, which we shall have difficulty in filling.’ H C/11/A/48.

My dear Montagu,

It is so cold & dark everywhere,’ as I am told, that I have not left town, where one is
at least, warm, & familiar with the / scene, tho’ one may not be able to see it.

I am much harassed about poor Rose’s affair. They have got some new charge
against the individual most / interested in the matter.’ It is, at present, more dark,
than definite. I am trying to combat these difficulties.

As your return may be delayed,? I wish you / would write to Fremantle, & ask him

Dismissed from his post as sub-inspector in the factory department of the home office in August 1867 (see
vil 2974n1), Frederic W. Haydon had informed D from Mayfair on 2 January 1868 (in a letter docketed by
Fremantle) that he had been writing ‘a concise Statement of an intricate case full of perplexing details’
and that he felt ‘cast adrift upon the world, with my prospects ruined, & my official career destroyed,
by an act of the most undeserved severity.’ The paper of the cover (see ec) matches that of Haydon’s
12-page letter to D of 4 January 1868 outlining the background of his case, including his ‘maltreatment’
by his immediate superior, Robert Baker (see 4982n1), whose twelve charges against him had led to an
inquiry and then to Haydon’s dismissal. He enclosed for D a detailed 19-page handwritten ‘Precis of the
Charges & Replies’ in two columns headed ‘Charge’ and ‘Reply’. H c/11/43c-h. See 4670.

The temperature in London on this day (8th) was 33°F and overcast. The Times (9 Jan 1868).
Apparently Edward Watkin (see 46568nn1,2&6), about whom Rose had written to Corry on the 4th: ‘T
wrote to the good Chr. before leaving Town [see 4665&n2] about that wretched promise [of a knighthood] to Watkin which has caused so much bother ... Iam sure it would be a good thing for the Gov. to
pay Watkin this Compliment as he so much wishes it.’ H B/X/C/8.

In his last extant letter to D, dated 27 December 1867 on Wortley Hall, Sheffield, paper, Corry had written
that ‘The fog wh: has followed us, prevents my seeing the beauties of the place, wh: are many, I am told.’

Right Honorable | The Earl of Derby | KG.

My dear Lord,

Lord Robert Montagu, with accustomed naiveté, wrote to me, a couple of days ago,’

4 Fremantle’s minute has not been found; see n5.

5 Corry would reply on the 10th from Rowton Castle: ‘Even the political horizon is not so dark as the Salopian sky still remains, and I cannot wonder at your resolution to remain in town. The Rev Mr Maguire
writes again in a desponding vein, and I have assured him, today, that you neither think him a liar or a
rogue. I think my letter will allay his excitement.’ (D in 1867 had called Maguire a ‘blundering booby’;
see IX 4638.) “Baillie Cochrane writes me a statement of his Income, as in the event of “certain considerations arising” the information may be important. Scotch Property £11.000 from now. When out of lease,
in three years £14.000. His Father’s property not taken into consideration in the above. He expresses
himself much gratified by the offer of Tasmania, and the manner in which you made it. I wonder if it can
indeed be true, as I hear, that Sir Richard Mayne has placed his resignation into the hands of Mr Secy
Hardy! I believe Shaw to be quite the best man there is to succeed him. But, doubtless, if this be true, he

to enquire, whether the expenditure under the New Education Bill, drawn up under
the instructions of the Duke of Marlboro’,? were to be included in the estimates??

I was unconscious we were on the brink of the precipice!

This / enquiry has made me think very seriously of a question, wh: has, indeed,
often, of late, occupied my deepest thought.

On our right course re the Education Question, not merely the fate of your Government, but of the Tory Party herafter, mainly depends.

The Country is not ripe for any large legislation on the subject, but will sympathise with nothing small; & wishes to be assured, that its rulers are / at least completely considering the question.

The course, that I would propose for your consideration, is this:

To Remodel the Privy Council Office:

To transfer the Educational Department, including all the Science & Art Institutions, to a Minister for Education:

To transfer all the Sanitary Department to a Minister of Public Health:

To confine the duties of the Privy Council to their original object: vizt. carrying
Orders of Council into operation.

The / Country will see by such a measure, that you contemplate acting, & that you
are preparing to act largely.

We should then be able to meet the New Parliament with a complete measure,
drawn up with all the advantages of prolonged observation & matured thought.

Such a measure would probably lead the new House; not yet organised into party
discipline; & might launch the Government with / the new constituency.4

I think it might be well to consider, whether Mr Walpole might not make a

2 Russell in the Lords on 2 December 1867 had raised the education question by moving four resolutions,
including the appointment of a minister of education with a seat in cabinet. Hansard CxC cols 478-506.
For Marlborough’s education bill, see 4677&n4 and 4678.

Derby, replying on the 11th from Knowsley, thought Montagu ‘premature in applying to you to know

whether the Expenditure under a Bill which has not yet received the sanction of the Cabinet should be

placed on the Estimates for the present year. But the fact must not be overlooked that at our last meeting
instructions were given to the Duke of Marlborough to have a Bill prepared for consideration, enclosing
certain principles which appeared to command the assent of the Cabinet; and a letter received from him
this morning informs me that such a Bill is in preparation, and has been placed in the hands of Mr. Fitz
James Stephens to draft.’ H B/xXx/S/471.

4 *Your letter’, wrote Derby (n3), ‘seems to point to the course of not attempting to bring in any Bill during
the present Session, which is certainly contrary to the understanding at which we arrived; but to make
very extensive changes in the Government Departments, involving a complete remodelling of the Privy
Council Office, and the creation of a Ministry of Education. Now I am far from saying that such a Ministry may not ultimately be found a necessity; but when you say that the Country is not ripe for any large
legislation on the subject, I cannot but think that the measure which you suggest is of the very largest
character, far more so than a modification of the existing system in the sense suggested by the Duke of
Marlborough; and, I think, less likely to obtain the sanction of Parliament. You must also bear in mind
that if the Education Department be withdrawn from the Presidency of the Council, you must count on
the resignation of the Duke of Marlborough, which would considerably weaken the Government. His

EDITORIAL COMMENT: C of Ex paper. Sic: 1852.

Jany. 10 1868
The Chancellor of the Exchequer presents his Compliments to Mr Blewitt, & would
feel obliged, if Mr Blewitt wo[ul]d send him, by the bearer, the Anniversary proceedings of the L. F., since he had the honor of filling the chair in 1852."
Mr Blewitt has them probably bound up: they shall be returned with / care.”
He would, also, take this opportunity of enquiring, whether anything is known of

5 Derby (ng) did not think ‘the public would regard with satisfaction the appointment of Walpole as Minister of Education. He was originally estimated too high; and his undeniable failure [see 1x 4158&n1] has
partially had the effect of unduly lessening him in public opinion. Nor do I think that he will ever again
accept any responsible Office. I shall be in Town on Monday the 20th and have desired a summons to be
sent out for a Cabinet on the 21st.’ Walpole would write to D on the 27th with his views on the education
scheme. H B/XX/S/471; XX1/W/74.

6 The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster was John Wilson Patten.

Blewitt, secretary of the Royal Literary Fund (see vu 598xn1), had written to D on 9 January: ‘Lord
Stanhope communicated to the General Committee, at their meeting yesterday, that you had kindly
consented to take the Chair of the next Anniversary on any Wednesday in May which might be agreeable
to the Society. The Committee have ascertained that they can secure the new Hall of the Freemasons
Tavern for Wednesday the 6th of May ... and they have accordingly fixed that day for the Dinner. Will
you be kind enough to make a note of the day?’ D had chaired the sixty-fourth anniversary dinner of the
Royal Literary Fund on 11 May 1853. H A/IV/M/96; The Times (12 May 1853).

2 Blewitt would reply on this day (10th): “We have a collection of the Anniversary Reports which we keep
for the use of the Chairmen of the Anniversaries, many of them being now quite out of print. I beg to
send this collection to you as it stands, (though it contains some reports previous to your presidency in
1852), and if convenient to you, you can retain it till after the Dinner on the 6th of May.’ H A/IV/M/97.

3 William Parker Snow (1817-1895) had held various jobs — including hotel manager in Melbourne and
librarian in Lucca — before becoming in 1850 chief officer of the Prince Albert (see below). His numerous
works include Voyage of the Prince Albert in Search of Sir John Franklin (1851), A Two Years’ Cruise off Tierra del
Fuego (2 vols, 1857) and Lee and his Generals (1867). After a brief stint in New York, he returned to England
in 1867 and spent the rest of his life compiling records of Arctic expeditions and explorers. His manuscripts were purchased by the Royal Geographical Society. Snow had written to Montagu Corry from London on 1 January: ‘Having to present my Papers to the Literary Fund today, and not receiving any further
letter from you, I venture to trouble you with a request that you will be so kind as to ask Mr Disraeli if
he will send the Committee a line in my favour. I wrote to him [letter not found], but have had no reply,
and it is necessary that all papers should be in immediately. P.S. You wrote to me on Nov: 23rd.’ Blewitt
(n2) would tell D that Snow ‘was formerly second in command of Lady Franklin’s Arctic Exploring Yacht,
Prince Albert, & afterwards commanded an Expedition to the South Seas. He published Books descriptive of both Expeditions & some other works, on the ground of which our Committee granted him £50
in 1858. He then went to America and wrote a Biographical work and various other minor publications
relating chiefly to Arctic discovery: but not being an American by birth, he could make no position for
himself in New York. He returned to England recently, and has been supporting himself by lecturing.
The Committee at their meeting on Wednesday granted him £30, the case being recommended to them
by Mr John Barrow & Sir Walter Trevelyan.’ H A/1V/M/95, 97.

Beauchamp had written to D ‘in confidence’ on 10 January 1868 announcing ‘my approaching marriage
with Lady Mary Stanhope [1x 4069n4] whom I think you justly appreciate.’ The ps would attend the wedding at St George’s Church, London, on 18 February. The Times (19 Feb 1868).

2 Beauchamp would reply on 16 January, thanking D for his ‘charming letter ... We all come up to town
tomorrow when I hope to thank you in person for your good wishes.’ H B/XX/LN/57.

EDITORIAL COMMENT: From a MS copy headed: “To Arthur Helps Downing St. SW Jan 11, 1868.’ H B/
XxU11/98 is an undated draft in D’s hand.

I am most obliged to you for sending me a copy, & an early one, of the Royal volume.!

I read it last night, & with unaffected interest. Its unique character would alone
ensure that: but it has essential charms.

Its vein is innocent & vivid; happy in picture, & touched with what I ever deem the
characteristic of our Royal Mistress — grace.

There is a freshness & fragrance about the book, like the heather amid wh: it was
written.

They say that truth & tact are not easily combined; I never believed so; & you have
proved the contrary; for you have combined them in your preface — & that’s why I
like it.?

Right Honorable | The Earl of Derby K. G. Dec 11 1868
My dear Lord,
Only a line to remind you, that there is, I believe, now, a vacancy in the Irish peer
age.’

Helps on 9 January had sent D a copy of Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands, from 1848 to
1861: to which are prefixed and added extracts from the same journal giving an account of earlier visits to Scotland,
and tours in England and Ireland, and yachting excursions (1868). The book, dedicated to the memory of
Prince Albert, would be published by Smith, Elder & Co and advertised as ‘now ready’ on 7 February.
‘IT have no doubt the Queen will send you one, herself; but meanwhile, I think you might like to have
an early copy from the Editor. I think you will like the book; and I hope you may not disapprove of the
Preface. If you do, you must remember that such a thing is very difficult to write. “Difficult” you will perhaps say, like Dr Johnson, “I wish it had been impossible”.’ The Times (7 Feb 1868); H B/XX1/H/438. See
4696&nz2.

2 In his ‘Editor’s Preface’ (v-xi), dated ‘London, January, 1868’, Helps recounts how the Queen had wanted
her journal privately printed for family and intimate friends only. Fearing that ‘probably incorrect representations of its contents, might find their way into the public journals’, Helps had suggested placing
‘the volume within the reach of her Majesty’s subjects’ so that they might ‘know how her rare moments
of leisure were passed in her Highland home, when every joy was heightened, and every care and sorrow
diminished, by the loving companionship of the Prince Consort. With his memory the scenes to which
this volume refers would always be associated.’ D’s ‘truth & tact’ may refer to a possible allusion to the
1867 Reform Bill, where Helps writes that nobody wishes ‘more ardently than Her Majesty, that there
should be no abrupt severance of class from class, but rather a gradual blending together of all classes, —
caused by a full community of interests, a constant interchange of good offices, and a kindly respect felt
and expressed by each class to all its brethren in the great brotherhood that forms a nation.’

1 William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse (1 278n2), had died on 31 October 1867.

2 William Chichester O’Neill (1813-1883), BA 1836 Trinity College Dublin, had been ordained 1837 and
appointed to a prebendal stall in Christ Church, Dublin 1848-59. In 1855 he had assumed the name
O’Neill (his great-grandfather, the Rev Arthur Chichester, having married an O’Neill) when succeeding
to the vast O'Neill estates in co Antrim, including Shane’s Castle. He would be created Baron O’Neill of
Shane’s Castle (UK) ‘in recognition of his support of the conservative government’. pis. See 4820n1.

3 Derby would reply from Knowsley on 12 January: ‘It is quite true that there are three Irish Peerages
extinct: but there is no available vacancy, as a year and a day must elapse from the extinction of the last,
before a new Creation can take place. I moreover greatly doubt O’Neill’s being willing to accept an Irish
Peerage. He inherits the whole of the vast property of the family, which gives him the absolute control
of his County; and having been not an English Peerage only, but an English Earldom, I hardly think
he would consent to fall back on an Irish Baron[etc]y. Indeed I remember that when he applied to me
for the English Title, he intimated that he would leave it to me to decide what rank he should hold. He
may however be sounded; for which there is ample time; and in the meantime I hold to our determination to grant no other titles till the approach of the general Election, when we must have a batch.’ H B/

2 Ina letter to D of 1 January, Rose had expanded on ‘that embarassing [sc] subject of the promise [ofa
knighthood] made to Watkin. The recent notification in the Gazette of the satisfactory settlement of the
Colonial Claims for honors in connection with the Intercolonial R[ailwa]y’ had brought Watkin ‘again
on my back, and has increased to some extent the very painful position in which I was placed last autumn
[see IX 44958nn1-4] when the hitch occurred ... through my indiscretion ... as Jimprudently gave the
information to an Owl when I understood the matter to be so far settled as to be past recall. There were
however no valid grounds for any objection.’ Rose had been ‘distinctly authorised by Corry to make
the promise and I did so in writing. I have good reason to know that Watkin performed his part of the
bargain and worked underhand for the Government from the very commencement of the Session. He
contributed I believe more than any one else first to make and then to widen the breach among the sections of the liberal party and on one occasion when he had paired against the Govt. and left Town he
returned on my demand by telegraph, broke his pair and voted for us, and on another critical occasion
when it would have been difficult for him to vote for Govt. he “accidentally” arrived a minute too late for
division. It was distinctly understood when the promise was given that he was not to do more than this.
When you so kindly confirmed the promise to me stating that you did so from personal feelings toward
me I of course wrote again to Watkin committing myself deeper and deeper and even named the day of
his being summoned to Windsor. If that Owl had not accidentally crossed my path all would have gone
well but after all a promise of this nature made with such deliberation will I am sure be held sacred even

This letter has not been found. Distinguished Turkish statesman Fuad Pasha (1814-1869), one of the first
Ottoman diplomats, had been admiralty physician 1834, Turkish attaché to London 1840, second dragoman of the Porte and director of the translation bureau 1843, first dragoman 1845, grand referendary of
the divan and commissioner-general in the Danubian principalities 1848, minister of the interior 1849,
minister of foreign affairs 1852, commissioner in Damascus and Lebanon 1860-1, grand vizier 1861-3 and
minister of war 1863-6. As head of the foreign office 1867-9, he had urged the Sultan of Turkey to visit
the principal European sovereigns and accompanied him as interpreter. For the Sultan’s lavish London
reception on 19 July 1867, see 1x 4474n4.

Tensions between Fuad Pasha and the Sultan had flared in December 1867 following an infringement
by a Russian man-of-war of a Turkish blockade on Crete. The Sultan had threatened to send the Russian
government ‘a categorical note’ and to punish a Turkish diplomat ‘for not having at least sent on shore

NO

and taken the Russians, as it were, [in] flagrante delicto.’ It was Fuad’s resistance ‘to these violent resolutions which produced the difference between the Sultan and his Minister’, and Fuad finally convinced
the Sultan ‘of the impolicy of pushing matters to the extreme.’ A second contretemps had erupted in
January 1868 when anonymous letters to Fuad denounced the grand palace now being built for him (at
the Sultan’s suggestion and expense after Fuad’s house burned down in 1865). An insulted Fuad had
threatened to resign but the Sultan, after realizing the malicious nature of the affair, had written to him
that he had been misled and was returning to Fuad ‘his full confidence’. The Times (22, 28, 31 Jan 1868).

ORIGINAL: BL ADD MS 58210
EDITORIAL COMMENT: C of Ex paper.

The | Viscount Barrington | M.P. Jany. 16 1868
My dear Barrington,
You send me bad news."
The Cabinet ought to have met immediately after Epiphany, &, then, there would
have been work / enough for it. As it is, the prospect is as dismal as Annesley Bay.*
Let me have news.
Yours sincerely, | D.

Barrington on 15 January had written to D from Knowsley that Derby ‘has got the gout in his right hand
& foot. The attack came on last Sunday, & I do not think it possible that he shld come to town as soon as
Monday next. He desires me to forward the enclosed for your consideration ... P.S. 6 p.m. Ld. Derby is
now free from pain this evening, & has just told me that he does not give up the idea of coming to town
next Monday. “This is only Wednesday, remember” were his words. Plucky man! I know he is very certain
to get to London, as he says there is plenty to do in the next 3 weeks.’ There were two enclosures: a letter
of 14 January to Derby from Russell seeking Derby’s and D’s views on purchasing ‘a fine Raphael’ for the
National Gallery, and one of the 10th to Russell from Gallery director William Boxall praising the painting, which he had seen lately in Madrid and which had been for many years ‘the glory of the Royal Palace
at Naples ... It would be difficult to overstate its importance or its beauty’. H B/XxX/S/472, 472a,b.

The small village of Zula, on Annesley Bay (also known as the Gulf or Bay of Arafali and the Gulf or Bay
of Zula), on the Eritrean coast, was the nexus of the Abyssinian Expedition (see 1x 4482n3 and 4521n4).
An advance force had landed at Zula on 21 October 1867. Some 13,000 British and Indian troops under
the command of Sir Robert Napier and over 30,000 animals had set sail from Bombay on 21 December
1867, disembarking at Zula on 2 January 1868. On the 25th they would begin a 400-mile trek through
mountainous terrain to Magdala, Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), which they would capture on 13 April. See
4890&n2.

Barrington on the 17th would write to p from Knowsley: “Lord Derby is certainly better, but there is no
chance of his being able to come to London before the end of next week. Under these circumstances,
he desires me to say that you are to use your own discretion as to the Cabinet meeting or not on Tuesday
next. P.S. 6.p.m. Ld. D. has been dictating letters this afternoon to me, so that is a proof he is a good deal
better.’ In a letter from Knowsley of the 19th marked ‘Confidential , Barrington would inform D that ‘In
consequence of yr letter having been put in the Office bag, which is always opened by Ld. D. himself, or
by his servant in his presence, yr letter of yesterday [not found], marked as above, was had by Ld. D, who
put it into my hands. He said that I cd answer nothing more than was intended in my previous communication, & I feel sure that he has entire confidence in yr judgement, & that you will act for the best.’ Derby
was ‘annoyed with this attack coming on just now ... I gathered from Stanley that there was no particular
reason, in his opinion, why the Cabinet shd not meet in his father’s absence ... I suppose it is hardly likely
that there will be anything of importance in the House before tomorrow 4 weeks, but from what I know
of former attacks, I cannot hold out much expectation of his getting to Town before the beginning of
next week, at the earliest. He is pretty free from pain, but cannot move in bed, although he is quite clear
in his head (no laudanum is used here, or at all events not to the amount given by [gout specialist] Dr
[Alfred Baring] Garrod) and he goes daily through the ordinary routine business with me, without mental
exertion. I had a talk with the doctor this morning ... It appears that the liver has been out of order, which
has added to the complication, but he has hardly any gout in the legs or feet, only in one knee, and in the
right hand & arm. The liver is now much better ... & the doctor is quite sanguine as to his soon getting
about.’ H B/XxX/S/473-4. For the 21 January cabinet, see 46778&nn2&3.

Right Honble | Secy Lord Stanley

Dear S.

Your box just come in." I’m in despair about the gout. The Cabinet ought to have
met after Epiphany. There is work / enough now for de die in diem.*

This is the urgency. Ld. Derby entirely disapproved of my suggestion as to the
treatment of the Educ[ati]on question by the establishment of an Educ[at]ion Minister, & / legis[lati]on for 1869.° I won’t give you his reasons here, being pressed for
time, & wishing you to see him at once. Enough, that I don’t contest his decision, &
believe that we must deal with / the question at once.

To deal with the question in a moonshiny way won’t do. The D. of Marlboro’ has
been with me all this afternoon, & has unfolded the project of the Council Office.
I / think it excellent: large, I would almost say complete; & yet moderate & prudent[.] But itis a scheme wh: cd. require frequent Cabinets, & minute discussion. /

Question is — shall the Cabinet, under these circumstances meet on Tuesday, &
again on Thursday,* when you will all have returned from Bristol & so on?

I think it best: we / can rough hew, & prepare the way, like Merewether® &
Phayre,’ & when yr father takes the field, can proceed to action.

See 4668&nn 1-3.

1 Stanley on the 16th had written to D from Knowsley a letter marked ‘Private’: ‘T enclose a copy of a note
from Lyons, by which you will see that it is doubtful whether the Danubian loan guarantee will be called
for. The secret I suspect to be, that a French company here got the money, which they would like to lend
to the commissioners on usurious terms, knowing the security to be good: but of course the commission
will not close with the offer if a guarantee can be had enabling them to get what they want more cheaply.
Bismarck is personally favorable to the guarantee, but says he must consult his colleagues. The chief is in
bed with gout: his spirits good, and we are not uneasy about him: but I cannot conceive it possible that
he will be fit to move before the end of next week.’ H B/Xx/S/794.

2 From day to day (Latin).

See 4660&nn3-5.

4 The cabinet would meet on Tuesday the 21st and Tuesday the 28th; see 4677nn2&3 and 4687n1. On
Thursday the 23rd D would be at Osborne; see 4680.

5 p and Derby would not attend the grand banquet (for 1,400) in Bristol on the 22nd given by the Bristol
Conservative Association. Hardy would note that Stanley, the main speaker, ‘read a well-composed speech

Oo

... wh. was received by the immense & enthusiastic audience with great appreciation’. The Times (23 Jan
1868); Hardy Diary 62.

6 For William Merewether, see 4653n7.

7 Robert Phayre (1820-1897), KCB 1881 and GcB 1894, enjoyed a distinguished Indian military career as
lieut 1840, capt 1848, major 1857, lieut-col 1863, col 1868 (3 Jan), major-gen 1880, lieut-gen 1881 and
gen 1889. Phayre, who had been employed to clear mountain roads in southern Maratha 1851-6, was
quartermaster-general in the Abyssinian Expedition.

8 Stanley on the 18th would record: ‘Disraeli writes on the education question ... the practical difficulty is
to do anything while R. Montagu is the nominally responsible minister: though industrious and quick,
his total want of tact makes it impossible that he should be entrusted with the conduct of an important
measure.’ Stanley would discuss the topic with D on the 19th: “We are to consider it in cabinet on Tuesday. D. was better pleased with it than I am: but I want further details.’ Disraeli, Derby 327.

The absence of our chief is deeply to be lamented, but we shall prepare the way

Mr Rivers Wilson
In consequence of Lord Derby’s not arriving in town today, (gout), an impression
may circulate among the Ministers, that the Cabinet, fixed for tomorrow, will not
be held.

You must remove this, & by all means in your power.

It / wd. not, perhaps, be advisable to give another formal summons; but take
steps to communicate individually with the members of the Cabinet. I have spoken
to Lord Stanley, Ld Chancellor, Sir John Pakington, Mr Secy. Hardy. Look after the

My dear Lord,
I hope this may find you better.’

I found our colleagues generally so restless & uneasy, that, altho’ against my own
/ feeling, I allowed the Cabinet to meet to day.”

The Lord President propounded his general scheme as to Education, & with very
great ability: with perspicuity & completeness.? /

What he sated proposed, or suggested, at once required at least a week for digestion, & I doubt, whether the Cabinet will re-assemble before that time: I hope under
your auspices.

Payment by results the only / test of public aid: an educational Census: a Conscience clause approved by the Archbp of Canterbury: the principal features of his
scheme so far as it was supported by the printed documents wh: have no doubt
reached / you; but he stated also his opinion, that the case of the localities entirely
deficient, must be met, & that he was having clauses (8) prepared with that object,
& wh: wd. be / ready in a few days. 1 These wd. be strong. !

I think myself, that we shall ultimately be able to lick something satisfactory out of
all this, wh: may do us credit: but it will be difficult work.

If / we succeed so far, I wd. suggest that the Bill shd be introduced in the Ho:
of Lords.* I think such a course wd might tend to its ultimate success.: & that if we
can stree hit / it off with the Bishops generally, it wd. soften many points with Ho:

enough in him inside to act properly, without mixing opium with it. He is better today than yesterday,

In the unfortunate absence of Lord Derby, he presumes to inform Yr Majesty of

Payment by results:
Efficiency the only claim for state aid:

the denominational system not interfered with or discouraged, but no conditions
in future, asregards fon the part / of! the State, with respect to the particular religious teaching of any school:

an Educational Census, ascertaining the exact state of the population with respect

a new Conscience clause, wh: appears to have been approved by the ArchBp of
Canterbury: but wh: is to apply only in places, where there is merely one school:

in / districts where there is a total deficiency of education, after certain proceedings, an ultimate compulsory power.

The Cabinet has taken a week to digest — & probably there may be some nightmares in / the interval, but the Cr of the Exchequer is hopeful, tho’ it will require a
little more time, that the practical conclusion will be unanimous; & much changed,

The Chanr of the Excr, with his humble duty to Yr Majesty:

The plan now seems, that the new Bishop is to be consecrated at St. Helena,’ wh:
is a See, & where the Bishop / of Sierra Leone, who is a negro,” 1& the Bishop of
Graham’s Town,!° are to meet the Bishop of Cape Town!4

It is difficult to say, whether this is more scandalous or absurd!

As soon some of these outlandish prelates hold chaplaincies under the / Crown,
& are really maintained by such means, Ffrave Ithe C of Er has! seen the Duke

2 MA on the 24th had written that she had attended ‘Lady Combermeres party last night. The Bernstorffs
were there & Brunnow & all expressed great delight to see me out again & looking so well ... 1am so glad
you had the 2 coats ... to keep you warm. I long to hear all yr adventures.’ H A/1/A/511. The other guests
at the Combermere party had been listed in mp (24 Jan 1868).

William Kenneth Macrorie (1831-1905), BA 1852 and MA 1855 Oxford, deacon 1855, priest 1857, curate
of Deane 1858-60 and Wingates 1860-1 (Lancashire), rector of Wapping 1861-5, perpetual curate of Accrington 1865-9 and Bishop of Maritzburg 1869-91. The Bishop of Cape Town, Robert Gray (see n4), had
offered Macrorie the bishopric of Natal, even though John Colenso, who had refused to recognize Gray’s

—

deposition of 1863 or to vacate his diocese following a controversy over his inflammatory treatises (see
vill 37418n4), continued as Bishop of Natal amidst the ongoing legal stalemate. The Times on this day
(25th), deriding the secrecy surrounding ‘the Natal comedy’, asked if Macrorie (who was to have been
consecrated on this day) was ‘to be exported to St. Helena as “raw material,” and there manufactured
into a Bishop? ... It is hard for the public ... to unravel the legal tangle which seems involved in this dispute.’ The Archbishop of Canterbury having vetoed the ceremony in the province of Canterbury and the
Scottish bishops having declined to take part in the rite, Gray would consecrate Macrorie personally at
Cape Town on 25 January 1869. Macrorie, as rival Bishop of Natal (with the title Bishop of Maritzburg)
would become the first colonial bishop not to be appointed by the crown.

2 Barbados-born Edward Hyndman Beckles (1816-1902), ordained 1843, had served in Trinidad 1843-50
and been curate of Holy Trinity Church, London 1851-8. He was Bishop of Sierra Leone 1860-9 (resigned
1870) and would be minister of Berkeley Chapel (Mayfair), rector of Wooton (Kent) and vicar of St Peter
(Bethnal Green). Beckles, in a rare photograph, appears to be Caucasian.

3 Henry Cotterill (1812-1886), educated at St John’s College, Cambridge, ordained 1836, chaplain at Madras 1836-46, vice-principal 1847 and principal 1851 of Brighton College, Bishop of Grahamstown 1856-71
and Bishop of Edinburgh 1871-86.

4 Robert Gray (1809-1872), BA 1831 Oxford, deacon 1834, priest 1834, vicar of Stockton-on-Tees 1845,
and first Bishop of Cape Town 1847-59, which at the time included the whole of the Cape Colony, its
dependencies and also St Helena (erected into a separate bishopric in 1859). In 1853 the Cape portion
of the diocese had been divided into the bishoprics of Cape Town, Grahamstown and Natal, with Gray
reappointed bishop of a reduced Anglican Diocese of Cape Town but with jurisdiction over the other two
bishoprics.

Right Honorable | The Earl of Derby | K. G.

My dear Lord,

I am greatly pressed with affairs of all kinds, & would willingly have given this
morning, preliminary to the meeting of the Cabinet on Education," all my
thoughts to that difficult / affair, but the restlessness of the Admiralty renders it
necessary, that I shd. communicate with you. It must be done roughly, & you must
pardon my inaccurate & hurried expression of opinions, wh:, however, I have well
weighed. /

The state of our finances will not permit any increase in our expenditure, but if
the state of our finances wd. do so, the requisitions of the Admiralty are unwise &
unnecessary.”

Last / year, there was the same pressure; on the ground of the great increase of
the American Navy. We successfully resisted the appeal, & it now turns out, that the
Americans have no navy, & not an Iron-clad except for / Coast defence.

—

See 4687.
First lord of the admiralty Henry Lowry-Corry had written to D on 11 January: ‘I am a novice in the Cabi
NO

net and, therefore, ignorant of the mode in which it has been the practice to determine the amount of
the Navy Estimate, but I was under the impression that it was usual to consult the First Lord of the Admiralty on the subject, and I was a little surprised to learn that it had been irrevocably determined without
any reference whatever to me. I can assure you of my belief that there is no business, however heavy and
anxious it may be, which can be more deserving of your attention, and that of Lord Derby, than the
present state of the Navy, but, after what you tell me [7 a letter not found], I am satisfied that I should be
only wasting your time and his if I were to attempt to induce you to alter your decision.’ Lowry-Corry was
convinced ‘of the absolute necessity, if we are to maintain our position as a naval power, of increased
expenditure on the building and outfit of ships of war ... About a month ago I drew up a Confidential
Memorandum showing the condition of our reserves of ships and the strength of our armoured Navy
relating to that of the French and the other European Navies ... My object was to obtain your sanction,
and that of the Cabinet in general, to a larger Estimate for the building and outfit of the fleet. I fear that
is hopeless, now, but I must let my paper go forward notwithstanding, because, otherwise in the event of
disaster, the whole responsibility would rest upon my shoulders, and my colleagues might well reproach
us with having allowed them to sit in ignorance of the facts, and of my opinion derived from those facts,
on a question of first rate importance to the country ... I send you along with this a copy of it [not found],
and you will see that it is a simple statement of facts and figures (and I think it right that the Cabinet
should know) with some general inferences of my own, but it contains no specific proposals in relation
to the Estimates for the next financial year, and is not, therefore, calculated to give rise to the controversy
which you deprecate.’ In an undated letter (docketed 30 January 1868) Lowry-Corry would inform b: ‘T
heard accidentally today that you had not seen the original of the enclosed [not found]. If Lord Derby
had been in London I should have read it to the Cabinet at the request of my colleagues at the Admiralty,
but I thought it right to send it to him in the first instance — which I did under the impression that, if he
wished the subject to be considered, he would forward it to you. Considered as a question of policy, apart
from finance what it proposes is, in my opinion, no more than what ought to be done in the present state
of the Navy.’ H B/XXI/C/442, 445.

3 A report of 8 January 1868 from Washington had announced that “The House of Representatives has
passed a resolution authorizing the sale of 54 surplus naval ironclads.’ Another of the 10th from Philadelphia had summarized the findings of a study ‘on the financial and industrial interests of the country’
submitted to Congress. It found that navy expenses had grown ‘from 12 to 31 millions’ and those of
the War Department from 17 to 8g. It proposed reducing these expenditures ‘by restricting the naval
expenses to an amount merely sufficient to maintain the police of the seas’ and by ‘cutting down the
[army] ordnance and fortification expenditures to the sums necessary for preservation and repair.’ The
Times (9, 27 Jan 1868).

Now it is the old bugbear of the French Navy. The American panic is tnow! a
French panic.*

The Admiralty wants a large increase of our Iron-clad Fleet, but it offers no plan
how this increase / is to be effected, except by the vulgar expedient of a large increase of the Navy estimates.

Let these |them! spend less money annually on small unarmored wooden ships.
Why do they maintain up to their present strength the / numerous squadrons of
small unarmored ships, that we have scattered over the world?

This is the key-stone of the position. We spend an enormous sum annually for
building & repairing these vessels / for their three yearly reliefs.> Why?

ist. For old fashioned notions, that we shd not, otherwise, have employment for
our officers & men:

2ndly. For our Colonists & Merch|[an|]ts, &c. /

There is no answer to the first reason, except the question, why we shd. keep up
more men & officers than we have employment for?:

As to the second reason, suppose an insult were offered / or an injury inflicted
on some of our Merch[an]ts in Peru or the Brazils, or the River Plate. Would any
Naval officer, in this age of telegraphs, take upon himself to redress these insults &
injuries? He / wd. send home for orders.®

But this Commodore of sloops cd. not exact reparation, even if he wd. The smallest South-American State has an iron-clad at command, that cd. destroy his whole
force.

The / Americans have flying Squadrons,’ & we must imitate them.

4 From 1858 to 1867 there were 36 British and 34 French ironclads ‘laid down, ordered, converted, or
purchased’, but in 1868, 8 British and only 1 French. Beeler 206. On the superior construction of British
to French ironclads, see Beeler 204.

5 The president of the Institution of Civil Engineering had recently castigated the spendthrift admiralty:
‘the sums applied to the building and repairing of ships have for many years past amounted to nearly
one-third of our entire Naval Expenditure ... Yet with all this enormous waste of our existing stock of
screw and sailing vessels, side by side with the construction of the costly ironclad Fleet which the exigencies of the country so imperatively demanded, the Admiralty seem to have expended a nearly equal
sum in building fresh wooden ships to take the places of the wooden ships which had just been sacrificed.’ Moreover, dockyard repair charges “increased prodigiously ... between 1859 and 1866, according
to the Admiralty mode of reckoning, which excludes much that ought to be included in the charge for
shipbuilding, while 7,800,000/., or thereabouts, was spent on ironclads, 15,700,000, or thereabouts, was
expended on the construction of wooden ships and on repairs.’ The Times (31 Jan 1868). For D’s earlier discontent with the admiralty’s excessive expenditures in ‘cobbling up old wooden vessels’, see 1x
4175&nn1,2&5, 4316&n1 and index. See also n11 below.

6 In a letter (signed ‘Historicus’) of 24 January published in The Times on the 25th, international law specialist William Vernon Harcourt had answered the question of the British government’s ‘position with
relation to the belligerent powers’ by quoting at length from an 1866 statement by ‘one of the ablest publicists of America’, maritime law specialist Richard Henry Dana: ““If [the contest] is a war, the commissioned cruisers of both sides may stop, search, and capture the foreign merchant vessel; and that vessel
must make no resistance, and must submit to adjudication by a Prize Court. If it is not a war, the cruisers
of neither party can stop or search the foreign merchant vessel; and that vessel may resist all attempts in
that direction, and the ships of war of the foreign State may attack and capture any cruiser persisting in

999

the attempt.

The United States had squadrons (naval units consisting of two or more divisions of a fleet) in the North
(12 vessels) and South (5 vessels) Pacific. The Times (18 Feb 1868).

I have not seen the second paper of the Adm|[iralt]y wh:, very improperly, has
not been sent to met, (as the first was,) !° but if it be full of the battle of / Lissa,9 I
ed can only say, that in that instance, the Italian guns & gunnery were notoriously
deficient, & that Tegethoff'® secured his wooden walls by covering them over with
chain cables.

A [catchword is An] / Naval Administration that wants to increase our Iron Clads
&, at the same time, wants to keep up a large Reserve of Wooden ships as well, & the
old-fashioned distribution of that force, wants what is impossible with the present
Navy Estimates, / wh: were largely increased last year."*

As for the Admy. view of the present condition of the French Navy, I believe it is
marked by the usual exaggeration & false coloring, wh: always accompanies those
estimates. / Five of the French Iron-clads mentioned, only mount the old weak armament, while we have only one labouring under that grave disability.

Let the Admiralty build Iron-clads, but they must adapt their naval policy to the
changed / circumstances wh: the introduction of Naval Armor has introduced. Two
wooden line of battle ships cd. be built for the cost of one iron-clad: & the armament of the present day costs 50 pr Ct. more than in / the days of “the wooden walls
of old England.”'”

Irrespective of all I have said, the management of the Admiralty, with regard to
ship-building, is at this moment so decried & distrusted, that, if the Ho: of Commons wished / to increase its naval expenditure, it would not entrust the office to a
Department constituted as at present.

But what is the state of our finances — & that with an a costly war? I have
directed the heads of the Financial Departments / to prepare provisional
estimates of the Revenue of next year. I received zt them last night — & it Tresult! is
most unsatisfactory.

We must prepare for an increase of taxation, wh: can no longer be limited / to
an additional twopence to the Income Tax. When a Chanr of the Exchequer has
to contemplate increasing the duties on Tea & Malt, the wild suggestions of these
ignorant & narrowminded Admirals are / doubly distressing.

8 The first admiralty paper may have been Lowry-Corry’s (see n2); the second may be the one he mentions
in his 30 January 1868 letter to D (see n2).

9 At the Battle of Lissa of 20 July 1866, in the Adriatic near the island of Vis (Lissa in Italian), the Austrian
Empire had vanquished the superior forces of the Kingdom of Italy. This was the first major battle between ironclads: 7 Austrian vs 12 Italian.

10 The Battle of Lissa (ng) had pitted admiral Count Carlo Pellion di Persano against admiral Wilhelm von
Tegetthoff (1827-1871), a distinguished career seaman (Order of the Iron Crown 1864) who had been
appointed commander of the Austrian battle fleet in May 1866. As chief of the naval section in the war
ministry (as of March 1868), he would initiate a complete reform of the Austro-Hungarian navy.

11 Naval expenditures for 1866 had totalled £10,676,101 and for 1867, £11,168,949, an increase of £492,848.
Beeler 192. The Times on 11 March had reported on the recent publication of the navy estimates, which
projected ‘total Navy Estimates for 1868-69’ at £11,177,290, the largest increase being under ‘shipbuilding and repairs’, including £150,000 for ‘“New Iron Armour-plated Ships”. The writer deplored the
admiralty’s failure to recognize ‘the great truth that the wooden navies of the world have ceased to exist
as effective instruments of war ... Wooden line-of-battle ships, wooden frigates, wooden corvettes are still
parading the ocean’, with an increase in ‘the number of vessels and of men’. See also 4697n2.

12 The royal navy was often described as ‘the wooden walls of Old England’. The phrase can be seen around
a broadside view of a full-rigged ship under sail on an eighteenth-century copper halfpenny token and
has also been used for pub names.

Confidential Jan 28 1868
Right Honorable | The Earl of Derby | K. G.
My dear Lord,
I wrote to you, this morning, on Admiralty affairs."

The Cabinet has just closed, having taken two hours on Education / — & to sit
again, | thereon, Saturday|.| !?

Yesterday, there was, at my office, a meeting of four or five representing the various shades of opinion, & their discussion of the question facilitated its treatment in
Cabinet to day.®

13 Derby on the goth would reply to D from Knowsley (via amanuensis Barrington) with a letter marked
‘Confidential’: ‘I must confess that for the last few years the comparison of the relative strength of the
British Navy with that of the other Navies of the world, has not been altogether of a satisfactory character, & ... we do not possess the preponderance of power, which needs to be considered as essential for
our safety. But on the other hand, there has been a continual increase of expenditure upon our Naval
Estimates which it is very difficult to justify or to explain. You will remember that when we looked into
the question last year, it appeared to us that there was very considerable room for retrenchment in some
of our Departments ... I believe that the Cabinet will be found unanimous in their decision that in the
present financial condition of the Country, we cd not apply to Parliament for a largely increased Naval
Vote with any hope of success, or grounds for justification. This question having been disposed of by the
Cabinet in communication with the 1st Lord of the Admiralty, I cannot but look upon the Memo of the
Admiral of the 17th of December [not found] as a most unusual proceeding. It is addressed to the 1st
Lord of the Admiralty; & consequently is framed without his concurrence, nor does the Secretary to the
Admiralty appear to have been consulted upon a matter for which, as dealing with the Finances of the
Navy, he is ... responsible. Although this Memo is addressed to the Cabinet, I doubt the expediency of
taking any official cognizance of it, but the 1st Lord of the Admiralty shd be informed distinctly that a
further increase in the Naval Estimates cannot be sanctioned, & that he, & his Naval Colleagues, must use
to the best advantage the Sums with which Parliament may think fit to entrust them. You may rely upon
my giving you every support in my power in maintaining the strictest economy, the necessity for which
indeed becomes the more evident when you are compelled to look forward, not only to an increase of
Taxation, but to an increase upon such articles as Tea & Malt ... Barrington goes up to town tomorrow, &
will probably be able to report to you as to my state ... I hope however in a day or two to be able to leave
my bed, & though I shall probably not be of much service before the meeting of Parliament, will make a
point of coming up the first moment I can move with safety.’ H B/Xx/S/481.

Stanley on this day (28th) recorded a 3 pm cabinet ‘on education question ... Opinion was strong in

NO

favour of an educational census, and of the creation of a minister [sic] of education as a separate department; on other points we were divided.’ Disraeli, Derby 327. For the Saturday 1 February cabinet, see
4699&n1.

Hardy on this day (28th) noted that ‘Yesterday ... Pakington, J. Manners, Northcote & self met at Disraeli’s on Education, not a promising prospect.’ Hardy Diary 61-2.

Today, / Hardy led off at my suggestion; I had previously, without indicating
any opinion on the alternative, mentioned that it wd. seem we had shed Ito! decide, whether we shd. introduce a measure grappling with the whole / question, or
whether we shd. introduce a preliminary measure, wh:, however, from its character,
shd. not be insignificant.

Hardy was against rating as now! suggested by the bill, was in favor of a Minister
of Education with large duties, / & a large area of super-intendence, an Educational
Census as proposed by the bill, the revised code revised, & introduced into the Statute (Bill) & one of the alterations of the code / being the assistance to the smaller
schools now not aided. In short to hold out, that it shd. be left to the Minister of
Education, after realising the results of the Census, to settte |consider & propose!
what further aid shd. be given, by rate / or otherwise.

Every minister but myself gave his opinion. They were all in favor of Minister of
Education except Dukes of Marlboro’; & Richmond, & Lord Malmesbury; most of
these spoke early.

The Duke of / Richmond was in favor of rating — of course, the Duke of Marlboro’, & Ld. Mayo.

There is no doubt, that the strong bias of the Cabinet, & especially of the most
influential members, was in favor of a preliminary bill as intimated by / Hardy, but
I gave no opinion; on the ground, that I had to digest what had passed for your
consideration, & that I wd. rather give my opinion on Saturday, when I hoped we
might, perhaps, be favored with / yours. I did this also, because I observed, that the
D. of Marlboro’ did not like to be deprived of his province,* in wh: he had certainly
shown, that he was not incapable, & / I thought that the suspension of our united
sentiments on the matter wd. be soothing to him.

I dine with him today,° & will endeavour to feel my way on the subject|[.]

God grant, that I / have a line from you before Saturday.

The Cabinet will also meet on Friday, on the Government of India & other matters.°

The Chanr of the Exchequer with his humble duty to Yr Majesty:

The Cabinet discussed the Education Bill for two hours." The very predominant
opinion certainly is, that / we shd. not attempt to grapple with the entire question
this Session, but that we shd. introduce a Bill obviously & avowedly of a preliminary
character, but not of a petty or an / insignificant one.

What seemed very generally approved was that there shd. be a Minister of Education appointed: that he shd. take, under the act wh: appoints him, an Educational
Census where required; that / the existing Minutes of the Council of Education
popularly known as the Revised Code, shd. be improved & modified in parts, &
incorporated in the Act:*

And that aid shd. be extended to those unassisted / schools, that have so long
complained of the indifference, & neglect, of the State 1: about 6000, it is believed. !

Here the great majority of the Cabinet wd. pause, & keep the question for future
treatment, shrinking from / instituting a system of rating, until its necessity was
clearly proved.

Chr of Exr. gave no opinion, but summed up the points on both sides, & said, that
he wd. communicate with Lord / Derby, & hoped to give his decision on Saturday,
when they are to meet again.4

On Friday, on more miscellaneous matters.°

Cr of Exr was thus reserved, because he thought the Duke of Marlboro’ / looked
mortified at the turn of affairs, & the Cr. hopes to day, when he dines with his Grace
to pick Sheriffs,° he may be able to put all right.

public schools are only 6,897 ... The great cause which deprives schools of Government assistance is
their non-performance of the conditions on which that assistance is offered, a non-fulfilment of which

Individually, I should peculiarly feel it. We have known each other, now, the

4 Grey would reply on 2 February from Osborne with a letter marked ‘Confidential: ‘I ought before this to
have thanked you for your very kind, &, to me, most gratifying letter, for it is impossible not to be deeply
gratified by such an expression of confidence. And let me say for myself that it has been my anxious &
constant endeavour to deserve that confidence, both from the Queen, & whoever might be her Ministers,
by the most loyal & honest discharge of the duties of my position. As long as I have the feeling that Iam
of any use, you may depend upon it that no personal consideration would induce me lightly to throw up
my present situation; & there are domestic reasons which would keep me in it for the moment, even if it
should become more disagreeable than it is. But to enable one to be of use, one must have the feeling
that one is treated with confidence. The mere suspicion that such is not the case, necessarily impairs, if it
does not destroy one’s usefulness — & renders such a situation as mine altogether intolerable. I cannot
conceal from myself that since, on more occasions than one, I have given unpotable opinions to the
Queen, She is become reserved with me, & in certain questions now shuts herself up with me entirely.
I believe, however, that this proceeds less from any diminution of confidence, than the fear of having

no —

things pressed upon her which jar with her inclinations; & it is this belief chiefly which induces me still to
hold on in a position, which, as I told you when you were here, is become very disagreeable to me. I wish
I cd. think matters would mend — but if, as Iam determined to do, I do my duty to the Queen honesily,
I foresee that they will only become worse. However, you may be sure that I shall do nothing hastily — &
I am much cheered & encouraged in holding on, by the kind & flattering manner in which you have
expressed yourself towards me.’ Grey added a postscript on the 3rd: ‘Since I wrote this letter I have recd
from the Queen (for the first time for some weeks!) instructions which certainly go to show no want of
Confidence, however certain subjects may be tabooed — & tho She may prefer not to hold personal communication with me! — You will see the nature of these instructions in a long letter I send up by messenger.’

My dear Barrington,

It is some consolation in all our troubles, that there is a medium of communication,
betn. Ld. Derby & myself, in whose fidelity & intelligence we can place the utmost
confidence|[.]!

I would not / telegraph to day, because, altho’, of course, he will not accept the
office, public opinion will be mildly pleased, that the Ld. J. shd be offered to Roundell Palmer.’

Besides it is as well that pompous Apis, Selwyn, shd. not be encouraged in his /
absurd self-estimate of his divinity.3

I wish, almost, it were an indoctum parliamentum again, & that we had no lawyers
in it;# especially, if that hound, Brett, is to be Solicitor.° They say, that Bagalley cannot assure his seat, & we must not / lose seats.®

The banquet was magnificent yesterday,’ & I thought of my having to dine with
Carnarvon the day he resigned.® We can’t afford another such a scene, & I hope
therefore, & believe, that the crimson liveries will still belong to one of our dear
friends’ colleagues|[.]

Derby, disabled by gout, had been writing to D via his amanuensis Barrington.

Writing from Knowsley on the 28th, Barrington had advised D that ‘with regard to the vacancy caused by
[lord justice of appeal Sir John] Rolt’s resignation, [Derby] is very much disposed to agree with the Lord
Chancellor, that, as we have had so much legal patronage to dispose of, it wd be a graceful act to offer the
Lord Justiceship to Roundell Palmer, & unless you let me know, by telegraph, anything to the contrary, he
will probably, in the course of tomorrow, make the offer to Roundell Palmer in the first instance — R.P.
will most likely refuse, and then Lord Derby will not hesitate about giving the Appointment to Mr [svc]
Selwyn. Mr Selwyn’s successor as Solicitor General wd most likely be Mr Baggalay [sic]’. H B/Xx/S/477.
Rolt had suffered a minor stroke on 4 January and would resign officially on 5 February.

D would appoint Sir Charles Jasper Selwyn lord justice of appeal on 8 February. The bull-deity Apis, a
symbol of the pharaoh, was an important sacred animal in Egyptian mythology.

A so-called ‘parliamentum indoctum’ (‘unlearned parliament’), from which all lawyers were excluded,
had been held at Coventry during the reign of Henry Iv.

William Balliol Brett (1815-1899), BA 1840 and MA 1845 Cambridge, a barrister (Lincoln’s Inn 1846),
Qc 1860, Baron Esher 1885, 1st Viscount Esher 1897, Mp (c) for Helston 1866-8, would be appointed
solicitor-general on 10 February (until September) and would prosecute the Fenians charged with the
Clerkenwell explosion (see 1x 4624n1). He would be knighted on 29 February, appointed a justice of the
court of common pleas on 24 August (to 1876) and would be justice of appeal 1876-83 and master of the
rolls 1883-97. According to Barrington (n2), Derby considered Brett ‘a second rate man, & a common
lawyer.’

Richard Baggallay, Mp (Cc) for Hereford, would be appointed solicitor-general on 16 September and
knighted on 14 December after losing his seat.

See 4687n5.

For Carnarvon’s unexpected resignation on 25 February 1867, see 1x 4338nn1&2.

Barrington would reply from Knowsley on the goth: “Thanks for your note of yesterday ... Our lawyers are
very bad, & as you say, have an exaggerated idea of their merits ... I have by [Derby’s] direction offered
the Lord Justiceship to R. Palmer.’ H B/xx/S/480.

EDITORIAL COMMENT: C of Ex paper. H B/XIII/100 is a much-revised draft of this letter.

Confidential Jany. 30 1868
Right Honorable | The Earl of Derby | K. G.

My dear Lord,

I am in receipt of yr letter on the Education measure."

It is with the utmost reluctance, but with duty, that I tell you, that I see no chance
of our arriving at a solution / of our difficulties by the course you indicate.

Part of your suggestions are of a preliminary character; others of a definitive.

The first, the Cabinet, subject always to yr fiat, have already considered, & / deem
inadequate: the see rest they look upon as only a part of a settlement, & one wh:
cannot be considered without grappling with the whole; & any forced decisions, at
this moment, on Conscience Clauses & Rating, & Board of Managers, / would break
up the Cabinet.

What the Cabinet decided on, I may say unanimously, was, that legislation was
necessary; that it shd be preliminary not definitive; that to be preliminary & not
insignificant, the institution of an / Education Minister was necessary, whose duties shd. be very large; no longer confined to the application of the Revised Code;
but harmonizing the system of lower class with pauper education; dealing with the

—

Derby had written on the 29th (via amanuensis Barrington) a letter marked ‘Confidential’, giving D ‘the
grounds on which our ultimate conclusion must be formed. I have received from you this morning two
very important letters [4686, 4687] ... I think that the Duke of Marlborough has shown great good sense
& judgement in the manner in which he has dealt with the Education question, & that looking to the
variety of objections which he had to encounter, his scheme, as a whole, affords the fairest prospect of
a satisfactory settlement. I think it probable that within a limited period, we shall be called upon to substitute a Minister of Education for the existing Committee of Council, but ... the first thing to be done is
to embody in an Act of Parliament the principles & conditions on which assistance should be given, and
in doing so, I would act upon the principle, which I am sure in this part of the country would be found
the most effective, of encouraging the denominational system without at the same time requiring as at
present union with some religious body. When free scope is given to Schools of all descriptions, & the
State assistance is made proportionate to results only, I believe the consequence will be that nine tenths
of the Schools will conduct transactions with some religious body. I do not [think] that I shd be willing
to consent to a principle of compulsory rating under the superintendence & management of some local
authority. I have very imperfectly expressed what I intended to say upon this question, but you will have
collected as my general view that our course shd be as far as possible of a tentative character, that we
shd obtain the sanction of Parliament to principles already laid down, with such modification as may be
found. I do not think that there wd be any difficulty on this principle in framing a modified Conscience
Clause. Setting out upon this basis, I think it wd be absolutely necessary that there shd be without loss of
time an Educational Census, which shd show where, & to what extent, such an assisted Scheme fails to
meet the public requirement, & it is only upon a proof that in no other mode can the level be reached,
found desirable, & withdrawn from the possibility of the capricious alteration of any body whatever. Note
is [stc] shd be a matter for subsequent consideration what shd be the authority to which the insertion of
the views of Parliament shd be entrusted, & that before dealing with the question of Rating, the amount
& extent of Educational deficiency shd be carefully investigated. I need not say that I shall be anxious
to hear the result of yr deliberations on Saturday, which I wish I had a prospect of joining, but I am still
unable to get out of bed, or to stand without assistance. Iam sorry though not surprised to learn the state
of yr Financial expectations.’ H B/Xx/S/478.

distribution of / endowments, wh: the forthcoming Report on Middle Class Education? will render necessary; supervising all the departm[en]ts of Art & Science, &, as
proposed by Lord Stanley & much approved, controlling generally Irish Education.

It was felt that / if our Bill were limited to Census & Incorporation, the Opposition would successfully start Mr Bruce’s Bill,? & the question of the day wd be taken
out of our hands.

It was felt, that if our action was limited to extending aid to the poor / schools, a
Minute to be laid on the table would be sufficient; & that in the present temper of
Parliament & the Country, that wd. not suffice.

I have seen to day several of our most influential colleagues, & separately, on this
matter. /

I have no hesitation in saying, that the project of a measure preliminary but of
magnitude, is the only scheme by wh: unanimity in counsel can be obtained.

I think myself, that success in Parliamt. might / thus also be secured|[. |

If we gain a year, the public mind, now in a state of effervescent enquiry on these
matters, will ripen on such subjects as conscience clauses & rating — & especially on
the / non-interference of the State with the Religious element in schools, wh: might
render Cons: cls. unnecessary, but time is required.

It is sad work to have to write on such matters & not confer together. / But Iam
sure you will pardon every uncouth & imperfect phrase. I only wish to be a faithful
Steward to you in your troubles, & give you the best information I can, & counsel to
which / the advantage of being on the scene of action, may give some value.

We all of us earnestly hope, that we may be soon guided & inspirited by your
presence.

I think it better not to have a Cabinet on / Education on Saturday, but let the
subject rest until I hear from you again.

But Parliamt. meets in fourteen days, & we shall be challenged the first night.°

There must be no uncertainty in our voice or / mien; especially if you, unhappily,
be away. They wd. charge on us directly. It is most necessary, that on this, & on all
subjects, we shd. be firm & decided.

The D of Marlboro’ is all right. He is gratified by yr appreciation of his labors, /

2 The Report of the Royal Commission known as the Schools Inquiry Commission (1868) compiled by Lord Taunton (also known as The Taunton Report), the most influential inquiry on education of its day. Appointed
on 28 December 1864 and its report signed by Taunton and others on 2 December 1867, the commission,
wrote The Times in the first of a three-part report summarizing its findings, ‘had to investigate the entire
field of Middle-Class Education’. The first volume, “containing the general conclusions and recommendations of the Commission, is at present prepared for publication.’ The Times (2, 3, 4 Mar 1868).

MP (L) Henry Austin Bruce, vice-president of the committee of council on education 1864-6, in 1867
had sponsored (with W.E. Forster) an Education of the Poor Bill, a ‘permissive measure ... [that] would
have allowed a popularly elected committee of management to raise a rate for the erection and running
of a new school, which might give whatever religious instruction it thought fit. The bill was withdrawn,
but Bruce introduced a revised measure in 1868 which contained provisions aimed at compelling local

Oo

authorities to ensure that there was an adequate supply of schools in any given area.’ Bruce’s Elementary
Education Bill, introduced on 17 March, would be withdrawn at second reading on 24 June. A very similar measure, introduced during Gladstone’s first government, would become the landmark Elementary
Education Act 1870. opns; Hansard cxc cols 1816-26; Cxci cols 1983-2011.

have thrown on the Ind. Govt. !4

so great a point of it, that I cd. / not refuse.

2 The Marchese d’Azeglio was Italian minister in London.

3 According to a report of 1 January from Florence, ‘a feeling of discouragement and dissatisfaction’
prevailed in the country. ‘Financially, the year that has just expired has been disastrous for Italy. The
combinations based on the Church property, and which at first were the groundwork of sanguine hopes
on the part of the [former] Rattazzi Government and its supporters, were sadly thwarted by Garibaldi’s
ill-timed enterprise [see 1x 4558n2].’ The country’s foreign securities were deemed ‘without recovery,
notwithstanding the news of the re-constitution of the Ministry, including Count Cambray Digny as Minister of Finance’. Digny’s new financial scheme ‘falls lamentably short of the mark. The pressing want of
Italy is not so much the replenishment of her Treasury, or the extinction of the floating debt, as it is the
restoration of her credit ... the deficit in the Budget should be supplied at whatever cost ... The danger of
bankruptcy is all the more threatening as it is indefinite.’ The Times (7, 8, 21, 24, 25, 27, 31 Jan 1868). See
also Axel Korner Politics of Culture in Liberal Italy: From Unification to Fascism (New York 2009) ‘Money and
Culture’ 66-83.

1 Stanley on this day (31st) recorded a ‘Cabinet at 4, where [we] discussed amendments on the India Bill
of 1858, and the elections bill about to be brought in, whereby the trial of election petitions is transferred
from parliament to the judges. We were pretty well agreed on all points.’ Disraeli, Derby 328.

Jany. 31 1868
The Chancr of Exchqr with his humble duty to Yr Majesty:

In the Cabinet today, the Parliamentary Elections Bill was considered & approved.
/ This Bill was introduced last Session & then referred to a select Committee, where
it was much changed, but not in its principle, one of vast importance; namely the /
transfer to the Judges of the Common Law Courts of all jurisdiction over Election
Petitions."

The Government of India Bill was considered, or rather the provisions, wh: are to
form a Bill. / This, if passed, will make Bengal a separate Governorship, & will also
improve the Council of India at home.*

The question of arming the native troops employed in Abyssinia with Enfield /
rifles was then discussed, & a despatch to the Indian Government decided on, wh:,
virtually, threw on that branch of administration the responsibility of the act.®

6 Charles Thomas Longley (1794-1868), BA 1815, MA 1818, BD and DD 1829 Christ Church (Oxford), deacon 1818, priest 1819, vicar of St Asaph 1823, rector of West Tytherley 1827, headmaster of Harrow 182936, Bishop of Ripon 1836-56 and of Durham 1856-60 and Archbishop of York 1960-2, was Archbishop of
Canterbury 1862-8.

7 For some of these ‘difficulties’, see 4707.

8 Barrington on the 29th had written to D from Knowsley that Derby was ‘really very much better today than he
has been as yet for a long time past, as you will see by the letter he has dictated to me for you [4691n1].
I hope you may be able to read it, but my hand is so stiff from shooting that I can hardly write.’ H B/

3 The new breech-loading Snider-Enfield rifles, issued to British troops landing at Zula (see 4668n2),
would increase their firepower from about three to ten rounds per minute. According to Sir Henry
Durand (see n5) in his ‘Minute on the Subject of Arms for the Infantry of the Native Army. Dated the
3rd April, 1868’, although Sir Robert Napier in December 1867 had proposed ‘to arm with spare Enfield
rifles some of the native troops now serving in Abyssinia’, there was no report that he had acted on the
matter. The ‘despatch of the Secretary of State ... calls upon the Government of India to consider the
question in its broadest and most comprehensive relations’. When Napier arrived at Zula, ‘the Field
Commissary of Ordnance was authorised to issue Enfield rifles to the 3rd and 25th Regiments Native
Infantry’. Henry Mortimer Durand The Life of Major-General Sir Henry Marion Durand vol 2 (1883) 386-94;

ORIGINAL: H B/XIII/101
EDITORIAL COMMENT: A draft in D’s hand endorsed in another hand on the first page: ‘? Feb 1868’ and
preceded by a small card signed ‘ars’: ‘? The “Note on the State of the Navy”, referred to in long Memorandum [not found] dated 4 Feby 1868 by the Rt Hon: H.L. Corry (to be found among his letters) commencing “The following remarks occur to me on reading the “Note on the State of the Navy” in answer
to the “Memorandum of the Naval Lords”|.]’ Dating: by context; see n1.

It appears !posstbly! tis alleged! by the Mem: of the Nav. Members of the Board,
that France has nearly double the number of Iron-clads that England possesses." tstThe! Question Tusually arises why,! when during the interval that their fleets have
respectively been constructed, the Expenditure of England on her Navy has been
greater than that of France.

Because during that period we—have—been with[ou]t due deference to the

Trevol[uti]on in! naval policy effected by the introduction of armor-clad ships, we
have been spending as in old days [illegible deletion] immense sums on small / unarmoured wooden ships.
We-eanrthavethe We can’t keep up a Tlarge! reserve of wooden as well as armorclads ships & we can’t establish a reserve of iron-clads, &! maintain at their present
strength numerous squadrons of !thenr! small-unarmoured ships scattered over
the world.

 
  

 
  
  

 
     
 

   

  

mament-of the present day-costs 50 pr-Gt / Yet on the | building & especially the!
repairing of their wooden squadrons for their 3 yearly relief an enormous sum is
every year expended wh: ought to be employed in buitding | supplying! our reserve
of Iron-clads|[. |

4 Victoria, the Queen’s eldest child, had been Crown Princess since January 1861. In Leaves, under ‘The Betrothal of the Princess Royal, September 29, 1855’, the Queen had recalled her daughter’s engagement
to Prince Frederick William of Prussia, who, on a visit to Balmoral, had spoken to her ‘on the 2oth of his
wishes; but we were uncertain, on account of her extreme youth [fourteen], whether he should speak to
her himself, or wait till he came back again. However, we felt it was better he should do so; and during
our ride up Craig-na-Ban this afternoon, he picked a piece of white heather (the emblem of “good luck”),
which he gave to her, and this enabled him to make an allusion to his hopes and wishes as they rode
down Glen Girnoch, which led to this happy conclusion.’ Leaves 148-9.

5 Although ma had fallen seriously ill in mid-November 1867 and had recovered by the end of December,
three months later observers would notice ‘unconcealable signs of illness and decay.’ Sykes 105.

The present letter repeats the matter in 4686.

Nn —

England’s naval spending consistently exceeded France’s: from 1860 to 1867, British expenditure had
totalled £91,124,985, while France’s was £63,213,954. For a yearly breakdown of these amounts, see Beeler
192.

I confine myself to this point. There are many in the management of our Navy
wh: require attention. With respect to the werk Testimate! of the strength of the F.
Navy, think I doubt its accuracy. I believe it to be exaggerated, & that vessels are
enumerated that are only capable of inferior armament & some of wh: are even not
seaworthy. /

Last year the H.M Govt, were nearly hurried by the same authorities into a vast
expenditure on the ground of the formidable state of the Amer Navy. H.M. Govt.
successfully resisted the agitators appeal, & it is now well known that the Un: States
have comparatively speaking no navy, & that their Iron clads are capable only of
coast defence.

The principles on wh: the vast sums tannually! voted by Parlt. for the Navy are
administered must be changed, or the H of C. will abolish the present machinery
of administration. /

What is the use of these squadrons? They do can ret neither! avenge our |honor! nor protect our material interests. If these first~vereimsultedim were Tinsulted

Feb 4 1868
My dear Lord,
The Cabinet has concluded the Education Bill - all tranquillised, & tranquil.’

In fact, the Cabinet is agreed on every principle; but / the D of Marlboro’ wishes
the Lord Pres[iden]t to be ex officio Minister of Education with no Board, a parliamentary Secy, & 5000£ pr annm.

He maintains that there is / nothing invidious in this, as the President of the
Council may sit, & it shd. be so declared in the Bill, in the House of Commons.

It is very true that Lord John Russell did sit in the House of Comm: as / President
of the Council, but the precedent is not a very strong one. He only sate for a few
months or weeks. Besides, he was no ordinary man, had led the H of C. for twelve
years, five of wh: / he was Prime Minister, & was himself of ducal rank.

The House of Comm: will never sanction this suggestion of the D of M, & will
feel, that, if carried, it will practically close the H of C. to the office 1 & an office wh:
they covet. |3

2 For the cabinet on Thursday 6 February 1868, see 4713.

Stanley on this day (4th) noted a ‘Cabinet at 3. Education discussed, no settlement arrived at, but the

general tone friendly. A committee of cabinet appointed to discuss the question.’ Hardy noted that p had

made ‘a long statement of Lord Derby’s views aimed at the President of the Council. I doubt its effect and
fear delay as inducing unpreparedness & so falling into snares. Overtook Disraeli & walked home with

him late’. Disraeli, Derby 328; Hardy Diary 63.

2 While Russell was president of the council from 12 June 1854 to 7 February 1855, Parliament was prorogued on 12 August 1854 and reconvened on 12 December. In May 1854 Russell had ‘capriciously insisted upon resuming office himself and becoming lord president of the council ... Granville was ejected
from the cabinet to make room for him, and Gladstone thought the whole transaction worthy of a set of
clowns.’ opns. Although the son of 6th Duke of Bedford, John Russell was not himself a duke; his elder
brother was 7th Duke.

3 Derby, via amanuensis Frederick Stanley, would reply on the 5th with a letter marked ‘Private’: “Your let
ter of yesterday has been a great relief to my mind, as I confess I anticipated serious difficulties from your

Cabinet of yesterday. I am glad to find that, from the present at all events, they have passed over. The

Duke of Marlboro’ is a man of a very resolute will and personally is entitled upon this question to every

consideration upon our part. There is no doubt that he accepted the office of President of the Council

mainly with reference to its connection with the Education Department, and he has applied himself
zealously, diligently, and not without considerable success to the questions involved in that Department.

But I confess that it does not appear to me that his proposal is practicable of permanently attaching to

the Presidency of the Council a Department so extensive as that which I understand to be contemplated

for the Ministry of Education. Before the Cabinet came to any conclusion on this point, I think it would
be well that they should have before them a clear view of the nature and extent of the duties which it is
proposed to throw on the new minister. They will, I think, be found to be such as amply and exclusively

to occupy the attention of any one minister even if assisted by a subordinate of high position. It may be a

question whether, or how, the new Department should be represented in the two Houses. That it should

the office of Lord President, and, as proposed by the Duke of Marlborough, the latter should be open to
members of the House of Commons, the result would be either that the House of Lords would lose one
of the few high offices to which it is at present exclusively entitled, or that the House of Commons would
be called upon to part with the supreme control of a Department involving an immense expenditure of
public money, and to the abandonment of which they never would consent. Much however remains to
be done before we are in a position to bring a substantive proposition before Parliament, and I think it

The Chanr of the Exchar with his humble duty to Yr Majesty:

A very good Cabinet, & did a great deal of business.

Went thro’ the / Scotch Bill & noted all points for the Lord Advocate, who will
attend next week.

Cr of Exr discussed with his colleagues every possible / contingency, wh: may occur in attempting to carry the Scotch Ref: Bill, & they were unanimously of opinion,
that, tho’ it is difficult to decide on such subjects / until one is in the field, that the
Scotch Bill will not injure the Government, &, in all probability, will benefit Scotland.

Talked over the Irish Bill, wh: will be ready for / more formal treatment next
Cabinet, wh:, probably, will be the last before the meeting of Parliamt:

Had great trouble about the Parliamentary Elections Bill, that is the / Bill introduced last year for transferring the jurisdiction over controverted elections from
the House of Commons to Commissioners legally qualified & investigating / on the
spot. The Select Committee of the House, to wh: this bill was referred, made it of a
much stronger & peremptory character & / transferred the jurisdiction, in this matter, from the Commons entirely & absolutely to the Judges of the Land.

Your Majesty’s Ministers proposed a new bill in deference to / this decision & the
Chancr of the Exr was to have brought abit Tit! in on the first night of the Session,
framed in this vein.

This afternoon, a / long & most able letter 'came! from the Ld. C. Justice of

of the measure was an “impossibility”: in short, the Judges struck!

This placed Yr Majesty’s Government in / a great difficulty, but they set to work,

EDITORIAL COMMENT: C of Ex paper.

Confidential Feb 6 1868
Lt Genl | Hon: Chas Grey?

My dear General,

The Scotch Reform Bill is certainly a rock a-head, but it is not a sunken one. We
have surveyed it in every aspect, & think / we can pilot thro’ the danger. I submitted
to my colleagues in Cabinet, yesterday, the consideration of all the contingencies
probable & possible in this matter, & they approved, / unanimously, of the course I
suggested, & gave me full powers of action.

Of course, until one is in the field, & !can! personally observe the disposition
of the House, & hear all that is preparing, / either for obstacles or assistance, it is
impossible to speak except provisionally, but as far as I can form an opinion, I think
we shall manage this affair in a way satisfactory to / Her Majesty.

With respect to the other point mentioned in your letter,* I would observe, that
the united action of the Protestant party, tho’ it may be modified, cannot be guided
/ by the Government, wh:, indeed, the more violent section of the Protestants looks

—

Grey on 3 February had written to D from Osborne a letter marked ‘Private’: “The Queen commands
me to thank you for having sent her, a few days back, the draft of the Scotch Reform Bill, with the accompanying Mem|[orandu]|m from the Lord Advocate. The Bill seems clearly & intelligibly drawn, & in
the points of the County & Borough Franchise, will doubtless meet with general acquiescence. But Her
Majesty wishes me to call your attention to the danger, which the Lord Advocate himself seems to admit,
of the objection taken by Mr. Gladstone & Mr. Cardwell to the increase of the total number of members
of the House of Commons, as a means of giving Additional Representatives to Scotland, being successfully urged.’ The Queen believed ‘that the question of the distribution of seats in England, will inevitably
be raised again in one shape or other, & that the result of a discussion upon it must be doubtful. What
Her Majesty is, therefore, most anxious to know, is, how this may possibly affect the Government? And
she wishes me to press upon you most strongly the expediency of adopting that course which will least
endanger its stability. H.M. would deeply regret a vote which should place the Govt under the necessity
of either resigning, or of disappointing Scotland in the expectation of getting the additional members to
which she seems fairly entitled.’ H B/XIxX/D/37.

2 Grey (n1) in a postscript had expanded on ‘another subject which gives Her Majesty much uneasiness. It
is the appearance, as an advertisement, in the Times of Saturday, of a Manifesto from what is termed the
“Protestant Central Defence Association”, which appears to Her Majesty to be calculated only to inflame
the Religious animosities which are the bane of Ireland. She regrets to see that it is signed by some of the
Irish Members of Government, &, above all, by the brother & son of the Lord Lieutenant! Nobody, as you
well know can be more opposed than the Queen to the doctrines of the Roman Catholics, & especially
to what is called the Ultra-Montane Party amongst them; and the language used by Cardinal Cullen &
his Adherents cannot be too strongly condemned. But in the present state of Ireland, this open arraying
of the Members of one Church, against the others, seems to Her Majesty to be singularly injudicious.’
The ‘Manifesto’ was a series of five resolutions agreed to at the preliminary meeting of the Association
in Dublin on 29 November 1867, followed by an ‘address to the Protestants of Ireland of all denominations’ (dated 13 January 1868). It outlined, among other threats, the dangers of ““a sacerdotal conspiracy,
organised by the Ultramontane party”’ and led by Cardinal Cullen, whose object was
Protestantism, and the establishment of a hierarchical supremacy, exercising exclusive control over the
education of the people”. The Times (1 Feb 1868). See n6.

upon with some distrust, in consequence of the liberal & enlightened policy of Lord
Mayo.

It is, however, satisfactory to / observe, that the present movement is really a Protestant, & not a mere Orange, affair, as the presence of many persons of influence,
like Ld. Oranmore,? Mr Peel Dawson‘ & others, who have always discountenanced
Orangeism, / testifies.

Further, it must also be recollected, that the movement, in this instance, is defensive, & has been elicited by the manifesto of Dean O’Brien & the southern priests in
favor of a repeal of the Union,>® & / other proceedings of that character.

It is, in my opinion, to be regretted, that the son of the Ld. Lieutenant cd. not
avoid mixing himself up in the declaration, but we must not forget, that young
Claud / Hamilton is member for Derry, & that his seat would certainly have been
forfeited, had he refused his signature.

It is not impossible, that the elder Claud found himself in the same predicament.®

The Attorney General,’ who / represents the most purely Protestant Const[ituen]
cy in Ireland, namely Trinity Coll:, consulted the Ld. Lt. & Ld. Mayo as to his course,
& they impressed upon him, so strongly, the impropriety of one who fills the now
no longer-sinecure / office of Public Prosecutor, associating his name, at this moment, with anything like party passion, that he declined to sanction the declaration,
& wrote a letter to its originators in the sense expressed by Her Majestys representative [.]

by the ultramontanism of Pope Pius rx. He had founded the Catholic Young Men’s Society (modelled on
the Protestant YMCA, founded 1844) in 1849 and had been president until 1866, when he became Dean
of Limerick. According to O’Brien’s ‘Limerick declaration’ of December 1867, a petition of Limerick
priests favouring what would become known as home rule, ““the only means of effectually tranquillizing
Ireland is by a restoration of her nationality”’ and the British Parliament ‘““will never satisfy the yearnings

What do you think of a New Devon Commission?

There has been no enquiry of the kind since the famine.'

Delane / has made the suggestion, more than once, to Stanley, who has, several
times, pressed it on me.’

Sir Robert Peel in 1844 had appointed a commission to research the problems with Irish land leases (the
first time a British government had taken such a step). Headed by William Courtenay (1777-1859), 10th
Earl Devon, it had reported that the population of Ireland had risen from six to eight million people and
that leases were favourable to (usually Anglo-Irish) landowners. The report, released in February 1845,
a few months before the outbreak of the potato blight of 1845-52, had concluded that ““the agricultural
labourer of Ireland continues to suffer the greatest privations and hardships ... he is badly housed, badly
fed, badly clothed, and badly paid for his labour.” Quoted in Richard Barry O’Brien The Home-Ruler’s
Manual (1890) 129. See 4784.

2 Stanley on 24 January had recorded a meeting with Times editor John Delane, who ‘anticipates an outbreak in Ireland next spring; wants a new Devon commission to enquire into land-tenures, arguing that

—

the landlords’ side of the case has never been fairly stated, and that in this way, many prevalent fallacies
will be exposed.’ The following day Stanley had written to D about that meeting. ‘He thinks there will
be a fresh attack in Ireland some time in the spring. No reason assigned, but his opinion on this fact is
strong. He advises a Devon commission to enquire into the whole subject of law, saying that the landlords
never have had their case fairly stated.’ On 8 February Stanley would record that the previous night he
had broached the idea with Mayo, who was ‘well inclined, but thinks the selection of men to serve upon
it will not be easy.’ On the 15th he would note that the issue had been discussed in cabinet that day “but
no result was come to’ and on the 22nd that in that day’s cabinet ‘We agreed to a new Devon commission,
and a limited land-bill.’ Disraeli, Derby 327-30; H B/XX/S/796. The Devon Commission’s report would be
submitted on 20 September 1870 and published in 1871.

Bill. Not only was it distinctly understood in November that that Measure should be brought forward in
the House of Lords, but I wrote some weeks since, to press it upon his particular attention, adding at the
same time that the Duke of Richmond would probably have ready the Bill on the Mercantile Marine.
His answer left me no room to doubt but that, for his part, he should be perfectly prepared, and that
although the Duke of Richmond thought that the Mercantile Marine must be introduced in the H. of
Commons, he should have one ready which should require some attention on the subject of Railways. I
shall look anxiously for the Report of today’s proceedings.’ The Bankruptcy Acts Repeal Bill would be

There was much pretended displeasure about the Judges refusal to assist try Election petitions. The truth is, that all those, who are opposed to the House of / Commons relinquishing its jurisdiction in this matter, made the refusal of the Judges an

In the House on this day (13th) D had introduced the Election Petitions and Corrupt Practices at Elections Bill. Pointing outthat the Election Petitions Act 1848 had transferred the House’s authority to a
tribunal, D underlined that ‘at no time perhaps have there been, more than recently, greater complaints
and charges against the inefficiency and unsatisfactory character of that tribunal’. But as the present bill
had recently been compromised by the Queen’s Bench judges’ refusal to preside over election petition
cases (see 4710&n4), D had proposed the formation of ‘a new and original tribunal’ of three members
and a ‘new court, to be called the Parliamentary Elections Court, or some technical name of that kind’,
whose judges would earn £2,000 yearly. D’s speech had been followed by brief comments from nineteen
members, including Gladstone, who approved of the transfer of jurisdiction from the House to the court,
especially as it would allow for expeditious local inquiry. As it stood now, he said, election petitions were
often not decided until four or five months into the session, during which time “most important votes
have been given — votes, perhaps, deciding the fate of great measures, or the fate of administrations — by
Gentlemen who are not the true representatives of the electors of the kingdom.’ He believed, however,
that ‘all the difficulty of principle and practice would be raised to a maximum by the endeavour to create a tribunal which will be judicial in its character, and which will not have the immense advantages of
reputation which attach to the Courts of Law in Westminster Hall’. Hansard cxc cols 693-728 (D 693-702).

shepherds, some from considerable distances, were present. James Henderson, shepherd, Huntlywood,
was called to the chair, and read a paper on the subject showing the hardship and evils of this tax. It
was explained that they could either petition Parliament through the petition from all Berwickshire, or
by a separate one from Gordon district only. The former course was unanimously agreed upon, and it
was resolved to communicate with the originators of the Berwickshire petition.’ In his lengthy paper,
Henderson had stated: ‘“We consider the taxing of a bona fide shepherd’s dog an unjust act of legislation,

it is hard upon the shepherd to have to pay 5s. for his dog; but I do not admit that it is hard for the shepherd’s employer to have to do so. When we reduced the tax upon dogs to 5s., we thought no exemption

Confidential Feb 14 1868

Right Honorable | The Earl of Derby | K. G.

My dear Lord,

I received your letter this morning, & learn, with deep regret, that there is no im
mediate prospect of the Cabinet having the advantage / of yr guidance & authority.’
I cannot shut my eyes to the danger of the present state of affairs, but, after twenty

years of confidential co-operation, scarcely with a cloud, I need not, I feel con
vinced, / assure you, at this critical moment, that all shall be done on my part, wh:

Derby on the 13th had written to p from Knowsley (via amanuensis Lady Derby) a letter marked ‘Confidential’: ‘Parliament sitting, and I still lying here like a useless log! You may imagine how much this
annoys me, and the more so as, although I hope that I have turned the corner within the last day or two,
after a slight relapse of three of four days, my Doctors (for I have two in attendance) will not venture
to name any time for my probable removal. I have no doubt you were as much surprised as I was at the
Article which lately appeared in the Times — but except as to my intention of immediate resignation, I
cannot say that I think the writer was very wrong in the views which he has taken. I have for some time
been aware that the increased frequency of my attacks of illness would, at no distant period, incapacitate me for the discharge of my public duties. During the past year I have hardly ever been really well,
& the steps which I have been obliged to take for patching myself up for particular occasions, have not
been without their effect on my general health — and I am warned that there are symptoms which will
require constant vigilance, probably for the remainder of my life, if I wish to guard against a sudden and
complete break-up. To no one except the Queen, have I communicated upon this subject, on which it
is due to you that I should receive the earliest intelligence. What I have said however to H.M. is simply
this — that while on the one hand my increasing infirmities hold out little expectation of my being able
for any long period to serve H. Majesty, I hoped She would do me the justice to believe that I would not
willingly desert Her service during a period of difficulty. But that if the appearance of political affairs
should be smooth, I hoped that H.M. would bear in mind my anxious desire to be relieved from duties
to which I should shortly find myself unequal. I added that I thought it was right that H.M. should be the
First Person to receive an intimation of my views, in order that She might have full time to consider the
course which it might be necessary for Her to pursue. Nothing could be kinder and more considerate
than the answer which I received, in which, after some gratifying expressions of Her personal feeling, &
the assurance that She shrank from the idea of being deprived of my services, She added that She had
no right to place Her own wishes in opposition to the consideration of health, and even of Life, which I
brought before Her. She hoped however at all events that my Resignation would not be tendered during
the course of the present Session — and to this I have no hesitation in agreeing, so long as my Colleagues
are willing to overlook the probably inefficient manner in which I shall be able to discharge my duties.
To no other Member of the Cabinet, not even to Stanley, have I made my intentions known — but what
particularly pleased me in the Queen’s answer was, that She by no means contemplated the break-up of
the present Government as the result of my retirement. And I am sure that, so far as She is concerned,
you, with the aid of the majority of our present Colleagues, will receive the same cordial support which I
have enjoyed.’ H B/IX/F/2.

Feb 14 1868
The Chanr of the Excheqr with his humble duty to yr Majesty:
A tranquil night; the House in good working gear.
The Public Schools / Bill brought in by Mr Walpole, & an interesting debate."
Mr Ayrton made a very clever speech against it: original & incisive.?

2 D’s views on his future role in government may be gleaned from a letter of the 13th from General Grey
to the Queen, relating a conversation he had had with D on the 12th. Grey had reported that ‘notwithstanding Lord Derby’s illness, [D] takes the most sanguine view — & said he did not know that the Govt.
was ever more united, or the Party more cordial in its support than at the present moment — nor did he
anticipate any difficulty in the Reform Bills, believing that the wish of the Opposition was not to turn
the Govt. out at present. Genl. Grey then alluded to the article in the Times, on the necessity of a “reconstruction” of the Govt — vizt to Lord Derby’s illness — & the impression that seemed generally to exist
that he meant to retire — & asked how this wd. affect the Govt. & the Party. He answered that this was a
subject on which it was more difficult for him to say a word than anyone else — as the direction of affairs
having fallen very much upon himself, during Ld Derby’s illness, it might be thought he was looking to
succeed him — & he could say for himself (& this is certainly perfectly true), he had always acted most
loyally towards Ld. Derby in his unfortunate absence. No inconvenience had hitherto arisen from it. The
position of the Govt. had even been strengthened during the last week. But he could not shut his eyes to
the fact that questions might arise, when Parlt. met, which would make a reference that the Prime Minister at a distance [was] very inconvenient and he believed that even in the event of Ld Derby’s retirement
the Cabinet would still act cordially together — & that an arrangement might even be possible to gain additional strength in the House of Lords. Ld. Derby’s retirement, however, if it cannot be avoided, would
be a great misfortune, for the Opposition which was now inclined to be quiet, might very likely break out
into more more [sic] violent action. This difficulty must however be faced — for he admitted that since
the article in the Times of Tuesday, & similar notices in other Papers, the question of the position of the
Govt. was very likely to be brought forward. All this, however, was for Lord Derby himself, & no one else
in the Govt., to consider. They had a clear line before them, & he did not anticipate any great difficulty
in pursuing it. Genl. Grey asked him if, supposing the House determined, in opposition to the purpose of
the Govt, not to increase its numbers, but to give additional members to Scotland by extending disfranchisement to England, what he would do. “Certainly not resign” he said, adding that “it would not break
his heart” if it did so. He thought they would probably give 10 additional members to Scotland instead of
7 — and seemed to hope this wd satisfy them — tho’ they asked for 15 as the correct number.’ RAC B24 64.

Walpole, who had introduced the Public Schools Bill in the House on 5 December 1867 (‘“to make
further provision for the good government and extension of certain Public Schools in England”’), on
this day (14th) had moved second reading. The measure, he said, was ‘substantially the same’ as the
one presented in the Lords by Clarendon on 11 May 1866, itself founded on a royal commission report
devolving from earlier debate (following Clarendon’s introduction of the bill on 13 March 1865). The
report’s recommendations covered five areas: functions and constitution of the governing body, rights of
foundations, endowments and properties, management of the schools and the system of study pursued
in them. The schools were Winchester, Eton, Shrewsbury, Westminster, Rugby, Harrow and Charterhouse. Hansard cxC cols 634-5, 742-75.

Following Walpole (n1), A.S. Ayrton, to the argument that classical education had contributed to the morality of the country, had countered that ‘when a certain class of public men were most under the influ

Did I understand you, that the three new Iron Clads wd be completed this year?

ence of classical education, society was sunk in the lowest moral pollution’. He asked the government to
either remove the metropolitan schools from the bill (‘leaving them to be dealt with as a whole’) or put
them all into the bill ‘and refer it to a Select Committee’ so that ‘justice might be done to the children
of the inhabitants of the metropolis who stood in greatest need.’

3 In the House on this day (14th) Mayo had introduced the Habeas Corpus Suspension (Ireland) Act Continuance Bill, which he proposed should remain in effect until March 1869, and which he emphasized
was ‘absolutely essential’ to the Government’s efforts ‘to frustrate and destroy the efforts of the Fenian
conspiracy’. Nobody could say that in consequence of the suspension in Ireland of Habeas Corpus ‘there
is not as much freedom of action, freedom of discussion, freedom of thought, freedom of writing and
speaking in that country as in any other part of the kingdom’; the only freedom interfered with ‘is the
freedom to rebel’. Passage of the bill would be swift, with second reading on the 17th and third reading
on the 19th. It would be introduced by Malmesbury in the Lords on the 20th and 24th, passed at third
reading on the 27th and given royal assent on the 28th. Hansard cxC cols 775-87, 802-10, 982, 985, 1053-70,

of any measure on the Irish Church, on the land question, or on education — the three great questions
which agitated the public mind in Ireland’, or ‘any measure ... for the amelioration or pacification of
Ireland’.

On the verso of D’s note (most likely written in cabinet on 15 February) is Lowry-Corry’s reply: ‘None of
the 3 new ships will be completed this year — We shall launch either 2 or 3 of them, now building, during the financial year.’ H B/Xx1/C/460. In two letters dated ‘Feby 15’ and docketed ‘?1868’, Lowry-Corry
had written to D: ‘I am anxious to take the opinion of the Cabinet this afternoon as to the best course to
address in reference to Mr. Seely’s motion which stands for Tuesday next. In my own opinion, as well as
in that of my Colleagues, the persistent attacks which have of late been made on the administration of
the Navy, and which assumed for the first time, a personal character in the Times of yesterday, demand,
for our own justification, a searching enquiry, and we are disposed to think that the importance of the
subject would justify the appointment of a Royal Commission which would be free from all party line,
& might be composed of persons whose opinions would have great weight. I am sure the appointment
of such a Commission, the field of whose inquiry should be as comprehensive as possible, could be well
received.’ ‘We have 10 armour clads in Commission at home & in the mediterranean — 8 more are fitting
& will be ready for sea — some early in the next financial year and the latest by August. The Hercules, just

2 James Hannen (1821-1894), Kt May 1868, pc 1872, FRS and Baron Hannen of Burdock, Sussex 1891,
a barrister (Middle Temple 1848), had stood in 1865 as a Liberal for Shoreham and Bramber but was
defeated. As a justice of the court of queen’s bench 1868-72, Hannen was not regarded as a success, as
the court was dominated by Cockburn and Blackburn. He would be judge of the probate and divorce
court 1872, president of the probate and admiralty division of the high court of justice 1875, and would
famously preside over the Parnell special commission 1888-9, authoring the final report. The Times on the

3 Replying on the 2oth from Eaton Square, Chelmsford did not think it right “to be influenced in making
such an appointment by party considerations. The best qualified man in the Profession without any reference to Politics ought in my opinion to be selected ... I cannot help feeling greatly hurt that you should
think it necessary to warn me against acting with precipitation upon the present occasion and that an
idea should be entertained that I can be persuaded to yield to party influence when in my judgment the
last man to be made a Judge is not to be found in our ranks. I am compelled in self defence to have it

Derby on the 19th had written to D from Knowsley (via amanuensis Lady Derby) a letter marked ‘Confidential: ‘Stanley will have given you a full account of the state in which he found me, & will have prepared
you for the communication which I should not be justified in delaying, of the absolute necessity of my
resigning my present Office. I am certainly better, and I hope in a fair way towards recovery, but that
recovery must be very slow, & my Doctors not only do not encourage me to hope to move from hence
much under a month, but are unanimous in their opinion that, if I hope to regain a moderate degree
of health, absolute repose of mind & body for some months to come is indispensable. I had hoped that
I might have been enabled to struggle through the present Session; but as matters stand, my attempt to
do so would not only be a certain failure, but would involve risks of life which I am not justified in incurring. I have not yet written positively to the Queen, nor will I do so till I hear from you — but I ought not
to delay making this announcement to H.M. longer than is absolutely necessary. I am not insensible of
the public inconveniences which may be caused by my Resignation at this moment, nor of the increased
difficulties in which it will place you. I trust however that, if H.M. should send for you, which under the
circumstances I should think most probable, you will not shrink from the heavy additional responsibility. You may be assured of receiving from me all the support which, out of Office, it is in my power to
give — and, so far as I can, I shall urge upon our friends to extend to you, separately, the same generous
confidence which for 20 years they have reposed in us jointly. And I cannot make this communication
without gratefully acknowledging your cordial and loyal co-operation with me, in great times and bad,
throughout that long period — nor, above all, the courage, skill, and judgement, with which you triumphantly carried the Government through all the difficulties & dangers of the last year. I think that I ought
not to resign without asking the Queen if she desires to mark Her approval of my services, to allow me
to recommend some 5 or 6 names for the honours of the Peerage. I think to that extent H.M. will not
refuse my request. We have often talked over the personal question in connexion with this promotion;
& I should be glad if, in answering this letter, you would send me a List of those whose claims you may
think the strongest. My intention of resigning has been already surmised, & will, no doubt, be very generally anticipated — but I should be obliged by your not announcing it as an irrevocable decision, even to
our Colleagues, until I shall have had an opportunity of submitting it to, and having it accepted by, the

count, when you are convalescent, on your guidance / & support.

Frederick Stanley on the 21st would reply from Knowsley with a letter marked ‘Private’: ‘My father desires
me to thank you for the letter he received from you this morning. He will write to you in a day or two,
but cannot do so today, as he has been dictating a rather long letter to the Queen, and is not yet allowed
by his Doctors to do much. I rejoice to say that I can give you a satisfactory account of his improvement
since Stanley left, the day before yesterday — and at this time every day’s progress is of very great moment.’

Walter Long (d 31 January 1867), Mp for Wiltshire N for thirty years (1835-65), had written to D on 18
October 1866: ‘My Family have been Proprietors in the County since the time of Edward the 4th, and
Sir Robert Long, represented the County in 1433. Many have also represented it since, up to the present
Century during which my Father and myself and now my Son have been Members in succession ... In
1816 a Baronetcy was offered to my Father and declined. At the same time a Peerage was offered to the
Rt. Honble C. Long, and he became Lord Fainborough, but at his Death it became extinct. I have successfully maintained the Conservative Cause in three Contests, and no other Conservative would have
succeeded last year but my son. May I also add that it was at Lord Derby’s particular requests that I continued in the representation in 1859.’ H B/XX1/L/254.

2 Richard Penruddocke Long, mp for Wiltshire N since 1865, would write to D at great length on 7 November 1868 announcing his retirement at the dissolution (due to his wife’s health) and, deeply hurt at the
way his family had been passed over, asking D ‘to do this tardy justice to my Father’s, my own, & my family’s services, though he who for his long, close, & unvarying devotion to YOURSELF best deserved the honor
is no longer alive to receive it.’ H C/1/A/81.

Lady Galway had written to D on 25 October 1866: ‘Many thanks for your very friendly answer [not found]
... [Galway] has read your kind note, & will not object to my doing what is right about it, tho’ still disinclined to take any part in it himself. [f you advise it I will write to Lord Derby myself, but I feel shy about
it, and for the chance of its not being in any way disagreeable to you, have written the enclosed note for
you [not found] to show or send Lord Derby with the paper. Surely it is a very different thing from creating a new Peerage, & if it could be arranged, through your kind intervention, before there is a talk of a
Dissolution, I should be very glad as I do not at all mind the expence of an extra Election.’ H C/1/A/38.

remember, some years ago, forwarding a MS. claim, wh: he said was a copy of what
he had forwarded to you.®

I fear, therefore, that there is some other list of 1858-9 — wh: may / have escaped
Barrington’s notice, & yr recollection.

In the House, the superior claims seemed to me to be those of

Sir John Walsh’

Sir John Trollope, who has acted, of late years, as our leading Squire at troublous
/ & critical moments — &

Lord Galway — not very rich, but very true, & of “the old guard” of the days of
1846.8

Out of the House,

Mr Andrew Fountayne Wilson Montagu is / a claimant for the revival of one of
the many honors of the Montagus. He is much supporters by all the managers of the
Party, being a man of immense wealth & influence & one, who, tho’ very eccentric,
has / shown, & proved by his services, great interest in the welfare of the party.?

This is all that occurs to me. Young Long presses the services of his father & family: & what he considers a promise to the / former.

5 Sir John Trollope would be created 1st Baron Kesteven on 11 April 1868. London Gazette (14 Apr 1868).

6 Sir Brook Bridges would be created Baron Fitzwalter on 11 April 1868. London Gazette (14 Apr 1868).
Bridges on 22 July 1859 had written to D, enclosing several manuscript documents listing revived baronies, about the revival of the Barony of Fitzwalter: ‘It will I think strike you that it is rather from deficient
Evidence than any other Circumstance that I am precluded from claiming the Barony as a right, which
I am thus now compelled to ask as a favor from Her Majesty.’ He would write on 28 March 1868: ‘I avail
myself of your kind permission to convey to you in writing the request which I was anxious to make to you
this morning. I had seen Lord Derby previously, and he desired me to communicate to you that he had
given his approval to the bringing before you of the proposal which I make. My object has been to connect as much as possible the new Title which Her Majesty is graciously pleased to confer upon me with
the ancient Barony to which I have a claim.’ On g April he would thank pD for his assistance in altering the
title, as per his request, to ‘Baron Fitzwalter of Woodham Walter in the County of Essex.’ H C/1/A/31a-e.

7 Sir John Benn Walsh would be created 1st Baron Ormathwaite on 11 April 1868. London Gazette (14 Apr
1868).

8 According to Sir Henry Edwards, writing to D in 1862, Trollope ‘represented a very influential section
of the landed interest in the House of Commons’. Qtd in M&B Iv 300n1. Galway, an Irish peer, was not
elected to a seat in the Commons until 1847, as MP (Cc) for E Retford, a seat he would hold until his death
in 1876.

9 Montagu, a descendant in the female line of Charles Montagu (Earl of Halifax, finance minister to
William 111), had bought out p’s huge debts, charging him 3% rather than the 10% pb had been paying.
Barrington would inform D on 13 September 1868 that ‘Delane told me that, if it was desired to offer a
Peerage cheap, that honour wd certainly be declined by Mr Montagu, ... [who] gave as his reason for this
that he had no legitimate issue, & meant to divide his large landed estates between his two natural sons.
At the same time D. said that he wd. probably spend lots of money for the benefit of the Conservative
cause.’ Montagu would reply to b’s ‘generous letter of the 2oth inst.’ (not found) on 23 September. He
believed ‘that my ceasing to be a commoner at this critical moment would so far as our Elections are concerned have an unfortunate influence. My agents work night and day as a Peer’s agents could not openly
work’. W.D. Rubinstein Men of Property: The Very Wealthy in Britain since the Industrial Revolution (1981) 201;

EDITORIAL COMMENT: C of Ex paper.

Friday | Feb. 21 1868
The Chanr of the Exr with his humble duty to Yr Majesty:

He has not troubled your Majesty with any report of the proceedings / in the H
of Comm: for the last two or three days, as there was nothing of interest, wh: wd.
justify the intrusion.

The House has been tranquil, but not / idle. It has risen at an early hour, but
transacted a good deal of business."

10 Derby would write to Dp from Knowsley on the 24th (via amanuensis Frederick Stanley) a letter marked
‘Confidential: ‘T was about to write to you when I received Stanley’s telegram from which I am glad to find
that you have no serious difficulties in the way of forming a Government. I hope that neither you nor
he, will have misunderstood the purpose of my telegraphic answer. You will not for a moment suppose
that I wish to retain nominal Office for an hour longer than is absolutely necessary; on the contrary, the
sooner the new arrangements can be made the better it would be for all parties, and the more agreable
[sic] to me, nor can there be the slightest objection to its’ being publicly known that my resignation has
been tendered and accepted, and that you have been charged with the duty of forming a new Administration. But I have only this morning heard, by a few lines from the Queen, Her Majesty’s acceptance of
my resignation, and I am promised a fuller answer, probably by tomorrow’s post. Her Majesty has said
nothing as yet upon the subject of the Peerages, and I have consequently been unable to write to any of
those to whom I propose to offer them. I require, therefore, a few days for the disposal of this subject,
and of other minor matters which I shall have to wind up, and which I shall have no power of doing after
you have once formally kissed hands as Minister. This final & formal step is the only one for which I think
it necessary to ask for a short delay. You have my best wishes for the success of your endeavour to form
your Government, and if I can be in any way of service to you, you may entirely command me. I will not
trouble you with speculations as to your probable arrangements, your main difficulties, as it seems to me,
will be the Exchequer, and the Lead in the Lords. Could you not, to avoid extensive changes, continue
for the present session to hold the former in conjunction with the Office of First Lord of the Treasury?
I know the work will be tremendous, but such a combination in former times was not unusual. As to the
Lords, Cairns would undoubtedly be a great acquisition to your Govt., but Stanley, who suggested him
as a possible Leader, forgot that it would be impossible for a Lord Chancellor to hold that Office. I shall
be most anxious to hear your contemplated arrangements and that you have every prospect of success in
the arduous task which you have undertaken.’ H B/XIX/D/42a.

2 In the House on this day (21st) in committee of supply, George Goschen had made a lengthy speech,
citing numerous financial statistics, on how improvements — in sanitation, accommodation for the sick
poor in workhouses, education of the poor — ‘could be carried out with the present limited resources at
the disposal of the municipal and parochial authorities ... In a great part of the country the burden of
the rates was so heavy that there was little possibility of carrying out further great improvements without
re-casting, to a certain extent, the present system of municipal and parochial taxation.’ Hansard cxc cols
1011-37. As president of the poor law board under Gladstone, Goschen in 1869 would introduce a Rateable Property (Metropolis) Bill.

On this day (n2) forty members had been absent.

agreed to a new Devon commission, and a limited land-bill.’ Disraeli, Derby 330.

in acknowledging your Confidential Memorandum upon the Irish University Question. I am still of opinion that, if it could have been carried into effect, your original idea was the best, of constituting a Body

1 Stanley on this day (24th) would record: ‘Disraeli sent for me, in some agitation, to talk over the state of
affairs: he had scruples about kissing hands etc. till he had heard again from Lord Derby, lest it should be
thought he was acting with indelicate haste. We agreed to telegraph to Knowsley, and apply for sanction,

4 7 4 7 To: GATHORNE HARDY [London, Tuesday] 25 February 1868
ORIGINAL: H H/LIFE
EDITORIAL COMMENT: From a typescript.

Right Honorable Gathorne Hardy Feb. 25. ’68.
My dear Hardy,

The Queen has accepted the resignation of Lord Derby and has entrusted to me
the formation of a new Government, which I hope, and believe, will not materially
differ from the late one.

confidence indicated, by a proposal to join your Government in so high a position I deeply appreciate;
& if it should be the pleasure of the Queen to entrust to me the Custody of the Great Seal, I cannot do
otherwise than place my poor services at the disposal of Her Majesty.’ Cairns would write to D again later
that day: ‘I want to write myself, at the earliest proper moment, to the Lord Chr. Pray let me have one
line “yes” or “no”, to tell me if I may do so now or should wait. Iam not in Court today, & if you shd wish
to see me I can go to you at any time.’ H B/IX/F/22-3.

Stanley on the 26th would record: ‘I went at 2 to call on Disraeli, and found his arrangements prosper
09

ing ... Cairns has accepted; Chelmsford expresses annoyance openly, but will soon recover his temper;
Walpole wishes to retire, saying that his position in the cabinet without office, is anomalous, which is true,
but the reason is, that he is influenced by his wife, who hates D. I see no reason why he should be pressed
to remain, but the Queen wishes it. Northcote and Hunt are the two talked of for the exchequer, but the
inconvenience of moving N. at this moment is obvious, and Hunt, though not in the first rank, is sensible
and laborious. He would in fact be subordinate to Disraeli: and at the present time it is not likely that any
important financial changes will take place.’ Disraeli, Derby 330-1.

4 Northcote on this day (25th) wrote to D suggesting Walpole or Hunt for the exchequer. ‘Hunt, I think,
would do his work well, and if you think Walpole would not do I think you had better take him ... If matters so turn as to make you wish me to go to the Exchequer I am quite ready; though I would much rather
stay where I am, with all the work I now have in hand.’ He would write on the 26th: ‘Montagu’s appointment under Hunt would I think be fatal. I have been suggesting to Corry the following[:] Wilson Patten
— Exchequer|[,] Montagu — Duchy of Lancr and then if you please you might put H. Lennox in Montagu’s
place, though I should have preferred seeing Cave there. I feel sure Wilson Patten, if he would take the
appointment, would strengthen us, whereas there would be a risk in putting up Hunt even with a good
Sec. Treasury under him, and with such a man as Montagu we should never be safe.’ H B/IX/F/19, 25.

5 Derby would reply on the 26th from Knowsley (via amanuensis Lady Derby) with a letter marked *‘Confidential: ‘I feel very sensibly your kindness in postponing, to suit my convenience, your formal acceptance of Office. My chief object in asking for a short delay was that I might be enabled as Minister to
communicate to a few of our friends H.M.’s consent to my recommendation of their promotion to the
Peerage. This I have now received, and if there should be any trifling matter which I ought to wind up
before leaving Office, Iam sure I may rely upon you to afford every facility for having it done. I limit my
recommendation to three, or at most, four — Walsh, Trollope, O’Neill, and perhaps Sir Brook Brydges
[stc]. Others may wait, and perhaps it may be just as well that they should feel themselves indebted to an
actual, rather than a late, Minister. You appear to be getting on very successfully in the formation of your
Administration. I shall be anxious to know your final arrangements, and cordially wish you success.’ H B/

Cairns were in the Govt. & agreed to receive a great deputation of the Nat: Union of W[orking] M[en’s]

such assistance as I can in your arduous task which I hope you may bring to a successful issue. I am glad
that you did not receive the deputation. The spokesmen were singular[ly] illchosen & their topics very

My dear General,
Ld. Malmesbury is all right, & will move the adjournment of the House of Lords: Ld.

of Commons.

I wrote to Mr Walpole, who is at Ealing, but expected in town about one or two
“to call for his letters.”

I don’t think I shall succeed / with him, from what Ld. Malmy. says, but I shd. still

1 In the House on this day (25th) Stanley would announce that the Queen had accepted Derby’s resignation and that D, ‘by Her Majesty’s command’, was forming a new ministry. Gladstone would express his
regret ‘that a career so long, so active, and in so many respects so distinguished and remarkable as that of
[Stanley’s] father, should have been brought to a close by the failure of his bodily health and strength.’
In announcing the news in the Lords on this day (25th) Malmesbury would remark how painful it was
‘for those friends who have served under [Derby] in office, and who have sat by him as I have done,
through many dreary years of Opposition!’ Stanley and Malmesbury would move adjournment until the
28th. Hansard cxc cols 1095-9.

2 Barrington on this day (25th) would write from White’s, ‘much obliged for yr letter this afternoon, &
most pleased to find that “all was right”. The details in both Houses went off, as you have of course heard,
satisfactorily. Knightley & H. Liddell have been dining with me this evening, & I am glad to find that they
speak so favourably of the prospects. Ld. Salisbury made an ass of himself, I hear, this afternoon at the
meeting of the committee of the Carlton Club, by informing them, a propos of the reception of one of
the Irish Law Officers of the Crown in Ireland, that he intended to blackball any new proposal of Mayo
& Taylor. He received no support. I hope you will not think it presumptuous on my part, if I suggest that
you shd have a meeting of the Party in Downing St, as soon as practicable, and that Stanley shd there &
then speak out as to Lord Derby’s wishes in yr favour.’ H B/IX/F/17.

1 Walpole would reply to p’s letter (not found) from Ealing on the 26th: ‘Subsequent reflection has very
much confirmed the first impressions which I stated to you yesterday. I have so long felt that my position in the Cabinet was so anomalous, & in some respects, constitutionally speaking, so untenable, that
if it had not been for Lord Derby’s uncertain state of health, & my great unwillingness to do anything to
embarrass him, I had intended, during the sess, to request permission to retire from it. I have plenty to
do in serving on Committees & Commissions — and for the present at least I believe I can be more useful
in attending to the business of the House of Commons, as a private Member, than I am likely to be in any
other Capacity. With every wish for your complete success in the well-earned position to which you have
been called.’ H B/XXI/W/75.

Grosvenor Gate Feb 25th 1868
Dear Lord Chancellor,
The announcement in Parliament has informed you of the accepted resignation of
Lord Derby & the office, which the Queen has confided to me of forming a new Govyernment — My first wish is so far as possible to recall to the management of affairs my
former Colleagues — but there are some obstacles to this course & the principal one is
found in the house over which you preside. If Lord Derby in his time was so sensible
of the weakness of our party in debate in the house of Lords, that he was constrained
to submit to yourself an arrangement which tho delayed, he still contemplated I am
sure you will feel that with out Lord Derby I have no ft option to have! recourse to this
plan among others of strengthening H.M. Government in the upper house of Parliament — if therefore for this reason, & for no other it is not in my power to submit your
name for the custody of the great seal to the Queen — in the list of the new Ministry.
I can assure you it would afford me sincere gratification if you could suggest to me
some other mode by which her Majesty might testify Her sense of yr services."

Believe me yours Sincerely | B. Disraeli

2 See 4755&n2.

Chelmsford would reply on the 26th: “Your letter has caused me greater surprise than I know well how
to express. You allude to the circumstance of “Lord Derby having in his time been so sensible of the
weakness of our party in debate in the House of Lords that he was constrained to submit to me an arrangement which (you say) though long delayed he still contemplated.” The facts connected with that
arrangement were the following. Some months before Lord Derby came into office I was sitting next
to him in the House when he suggested to me the importance of securing additional strength to our
debates & asked me whether in the event of my again holding the Great Seal I would be willing after
two or three years to resign it in favor of Cairns (not then a member of the House) upon receiving some
other high office such as President of the Council. I expressed my willingness to do anything for the
benefit of the party, & if I remember rightly I was reminded of this arrangement by Lord Derby when he
offered me the Seal for the second time. Some time after I had been in office & after Cairns was one of
the Lords Justice I pressed Lord Derby to make him a Peer but he objected on the ground of Cairns having declined the Dignity when he had offered it him & also on account of the Peerage not being usually
conferred on a Lord Justice. I overcame these objections & Cairns was called to the Upper House — Lord
Derby having thus secured a powerful debater on our side though not a member of the Government.
I did not anticipate any recurrence to the proposed arrangement & I learn from you for the first time
that though delayed it was still contemplated by Lord Derby. If so it was very unlike his open & generous
nature to have kept his intentions a secret from me. I may deceive myself but I am not aware that I have
failed in any instance in the discharge of the duties of my office either in the Court of Chancery or in the
House of Lords. You apparently seem to think that my services deserve some recognition though they
are not regarded in the formation of your new Ministry. But you ask me to assist you in proposing some
way of acknowledging them which has not occurred to yourself and in the passage with which your letter
concludes you say “I assure you it would afford me sincere gratification if you could suggest to me some
other mode by which Her Majesty might testify Her sense of your Services.”’ H B/IX/F/86. See also 4763.

Mr Disraeli with his humble duty to Yr Majesty:

He ventures to express, his sense of Yr Majesty’s most gracious kindness to him, &
of the high honor, wh: Yr Majesty has / been graciously pleased to confer on him.

He can only offer devotion.

It will be his delight, & duty, to render the transaction of affairs as easy to Yr Majesty, as possible / — & in smaller matters, he hopes he may succeed in this; but he
ventures to trust, that, in the great affairs of state, Yr Majesty will deign not to withhold from him / the benefit of Yr Majesty’s guidance.

Your Majesty’s life has been passed in constant communion with great men, & the
knowledge, & management of important transactions.

Even / if Yr Majesty were not gifted with those great abilities, wh: all now acknowledge, this rare & choice experience must give Yr Majesty an advantage in / judgment, wh: few living persons, & probably no living Prince, can rival.

He, whom Yr Majesty has so highly preferred, presumes to trust to Yr Majestys
condescension in / this behalf.

Mr Disraeli proposes to have the honor of waiting on Yr Majesty tomorrow

Barrington on this day (26th) had written to p from Downing Street: ‘I will not bore you with another
interview, but I must tell you that I hear from several that it wd give the greatest satisfaction to the Party if
you were to propose to Gen] Peel & Lord Cranborne to join you. They would refuse, as I understand that
they are rather bitter, especially the latter, but it would be a step towards reconciliation, & be generally
well received. Ld. Hylton would be the man to “get at” Peel. You need not answer this, and I dare say you
have already thought the matter over, but I considered it right to let you know what I had heard.’ H B/

Derby had sent D three telegrams from Knowsley. Two on the 25th — ‘Nothing this morning from H.M.
Can take no step till I hear. May do so by late post if so will telegraph or write’, and at 5 pm: ‘I have heard
from H.M. My formal resignation is sent in.’ — and one on this day (26th): “Many thanks. Do not wait any
longer.’ The ‘submarine telegraph between the Isle of Wight and the mainland’ had been out of order
for days and communication restored only on this day (26th). H B/Ix/F/6-8; The Times (27 Feb 1868).

EDITORIAL COMMENT: C of Ex paper. Sic: older.

Feby. 26 1868
Mr Disraeli with his humble duty to Yr Majesty:

All his late colleagues, except Lord Chelmsford & Mr Walpole,* have placed their
services at / Yr Majesty’s commands, &, at present, he contemplates recommending
Yr Majesty to allot to them the same offices, wh: they previously filled.

His difficulty, at this moment, is the Chancell[orshi]p / of the Exchequer. The
business of that office with a declining revenue, increased expenditure, & a heavy
budget impending, would be too much for him to / attempt to execute.

Sir Stafford Northcote would make a Cr. of Exr, that would inspire confidence &
satisfy everyone; but it would be unwise to take him from the India Office, wh: he
has / mastered, especially with all the threads of the Abyssinian affairs in his hands.

Altho Mr Disraeli is aware, that Yr Majesty is naturally disinclined to the entrance
of strangers / into Your Majestys service, he is nevertheless much inclined to eon
bring before Yr Majesty the claims of Mr Ward Hunt, the present Secy of the Treasury, to the post.

Mr / Disraeli would be much mistaken, if Mr Ward Hunt wd. not prove a very
distinguished minister of finance.’

He is a gentleman by birth, & member for his County: of Northampton; but being a younger son, / who succeeded to the estate by the unexpected death of his
brother, has had the advantage of a legal training for the Bar.

Mr Disraeli ought to observe to Yr Majesty, that Mr Ward Hunts appearance / is
rather remarkable, but anything but displeasing. He is more than six feet 4 in: hig
in stature, but does not look so tall from his proportionate breadth — like St. Peters,
no / one is at first aware of his dimensions.

See 4751n1.

See 4751n2 and 4754&n1.

See 4746n4. Hunt would write to D on the 27th: ‘I am anxious for a telegram respecting the Queen’s
pleasure about my appointment at the earliest possible moment, as I want to get my address into our local papers which are published tomorrow evening. I shall be at the Treasury early, so please to send the
message there.’ H B/IX/F/27.

But he has the sagacity of the elephant, as well as the form. The most simple,
straightforward, & truthful man Mr Disraeli ever met: & of a very / pleasing & amiable expression of countenance.

He has gained golden opinions in the execution of his office as Secy of the Treasury, & is so popular in the House of Commons, that the Opposition even intimated
recently, that / if a new Speaker were required, they were not disinclined to consider Mr. Ward Hunt’s claims.

This trait will convey to Yr Majesty the thorough respectability, even the high consideration in wh: Mr Hunt is held.

He is a XChurch man, & not / much more than forty years of age, tho’ from his
form apparently much older.+

Mr Disraeli feels great confidence in Mr Hunt, but of course is not insensible to
the responsibility of recommending so great / a promotion. He has written at this
length, because if, after still further deliberation, he ventures to recommend Mr
Hunt to Yr Majestys consideration, he thought Yr Majesty wd. like to know / something about a new servant.°

Lord Cairns has accepted Mr Disraeli’s offer to recommend him to Yr Majesty for
the custody of the Great Seal.®

Grosvenor Gate | Feb 27 1868
Right Honorable | The Earl of Derby | K. G.
My dear Lord,
I duly received yr telegram of yesterday, & yr letter this morning.’ I have, therefore, arranged to go down to day by 3 c’ck: train & / therefore, I suppose, in four
& twenty hours, the thing will be done. I hope, that Lord Chelmsford will have his
audience tomorrow, & that Cairns, & the new Chanr. of the Exchr / will be sworn
in on Saturday.

Cabinets on Monday & Tuesday: meeting of the party on Wednesday; & of Parliament, for business, on Thursday.3

I think Hunt must / be Chanr of the Exchequer, & I have prepared the Queen for
it. If H.M. approves, he must be summoned for Saturday; & then Stanley, tomorrow,
when the Ho: of Commons meets, / can order his writ to be moved.*

With respect to some intimation in yr letter of your wishes being attended to in
some slight matters, permit me to say very distinctly, once / & for ever; that, in the
position in wh: I am so unexpectedly placed, I consider myself, & shall always consider myself, only your Deputy.

Your wishes will always be commands to me, & commands that / will be heartily
obeyed.

I shall never take any step of importance in public life witht. apprising you of it
before it is decided on, & witht. at least seeking the counsel wh:, / I trust, will never
be refused.

March for his motion; & therefore that he will not interfere with the Government business of Monday the

5 Derby on the 28th would reply from Knowsley: ‘One line to thank you for your very kind letter of yesterday, and to assure you that, so far as lam concerned, there is no danger of any sentiment of estrangement
arising between us, who for more than twenty years have worked together with unreserved and unbroken
confidence. But I cannot accept for you the position which you are willing to accept for yourself, of being
considered as my Deputy. You have fairly & most honourably won your way to the highest round of the
political ladder — and long may you continue to retain your position! At the same time, whenever you are
inclined to consult me or ask for my opinion, I shall be most happy to give it you frankly & unreservedly.
But I shall not be so unreasonable as to expect that it shall always be adopted, or be surprised, still less
affronted, if upon any ground you find yourself unable to act upon it. Your arrangements so far appear to
be going on satisfactorily. Hunt’s promotion is a rapid one, but I think he will justify your selection. Iam
at a loss to make out whom you have to place in his very responsible Office. I have received the Queen’s
sanction for the four Peerages for which I had applied, and I will write to the four Gentlemen to inform
them. If the Queen has any fancy about a postponement, I should think that, to the three who are now
in Parliament, it would rather be a convenience than otherwise. Before concluding, let me beg of you to
offer my congratulations to Mrs. Disraeli upon your having attained a post, your pre-eminent fitness for
which, she will not be inclined to dispute.’ H B/1X/F/10.

is desirous of doing whatever she can to facilitate Mr. D’s task of reconstituting the Govt. — or rather, she
hopes, of continuing the Adminn. as formed by Ld D. — and she feels how essential it is that all the other
members [of] her Govt should hang together. Should you leave the Govt. at this moment, it might be
taken to imply either a distrust of the strength of the new arrangement, or a disinclination on your part
to serve without Ld. D., which cd. be very damaging. And I need hardly say that H.M. has always looked
to you, as to one of those on [whom] she cd. personally rely, & whose presence in the Cabt. gave her
increased confidence in the General conduct of affairs. I sincerely hope that this appeal may be unnecessary, & that I shall be able to tell H.M. that She may still rely upon your support & assistance. I shall go

I arrived here yesterday at 7 o’ck:, & about 2 an hour afterward, had my audience
of Her Majesty. I was standing in the / Closet when the door opened & the Queen
came in, radiant with smiles, & holding out her hand, saying “You must kiss hands”

her hand in faith & loving loyalty. Then she sate down, wh: she only does with the

2 Corry on the 27th had written to D from Downing Street: “On thinking it over, I feel almost sure that
the promise as to G. Bentinck, which in your opinion binds you, was made before the offer to him of the
P.L.B. Secretaryship, and is therefore, now discharged. His refusal was based on the ground that he could
not join a Ministry engaged in carrying a measure against which he had taken a prominent part. You are
going to introduce analogous measures this Session. Further, you only have it in your power to offer him
the very identical place that he, within a year, has refused. Surely these facts would satisfy Lord Lonsdale.
His appt would, I am convinced from what I hear, be as much ridiculed as Beach’s would be applauded.
The latter is the sort of working man very much required at the P.L.B. where Lord Devon seems to take
it rather easy. Barrington tells me that H. Lennox has told him of this morning’s interview with you, and
is perfectly aware that Robert Montagu’s is the place you have in your mind for him. This being so, and
his tongue such as it is, do you not think it would be wise of you to write at once & prepare R.M. for some
change? Hunt’s appointment gives universal satisfaction. I have not met, or heard of a dissentient; and I
have seen many people this afternoon. Taylor, Noel and Barrington are well pleased with the feeling at
the Carlton. Even Sandford tells me that he feels less hostility to a Govt with you at the head, than to one
led by Lord D. What you did last session might have been expected of you from your known opinions, but
Lord Derby’s conduct was unpardonable. He added that he heard of no rumours of attack which were
likely to come to anything: this he said with a disappointed air that amused me. Fred Stanley gives Taylor
what must be considered a bad account of his Father. He remains nearly as weak as last week, and so
nervous, that the mere reading or dictating of a letter on business raises his pulse — sometimes 25 beats in
a minute. Taylor repeated some more of their conversation, which was chiefly a narrative of events which
are known to you. He said that his Father had wished to continue in office till he could have given those
Peerages, but that, that being impossible, he confided in your willingness to carry out, in those cases, his
promise. Sir J. Walsh has been to Taylor today, but is not clamorous. I hope to write something more
worthy reading tomorrow.’ H B/1X/F/28.

Corry on the 28th would write from Downing Street: ‘I have seen Helps, since receiving your letter,

09

and have no doubt all will go well tomorrow. The House adjourned at 5, to Thursday. Lord Stanley said
Maguire would probably have Monday given him for his debate. Thereupon Gladstone, Cardwell, Glyn
and others on their front bench held a consultation, which has ended in A. Kinnaird & Trevelyan withdrawing motions which they had on the paper for Tuesday, and in Maguire’s putting down his for that
day (the 10th) [.] It is evident they wish the Irish Reform Bill to come on previously. It is down for the 9th,
but I suppose you will now postpone it, and take the 2nd reading of the Scotch Bill then; this being in
accordance with your original intention, and a “sell” for them. Henry Lennox hears that it is “not desirable that he should vacate his seat.” So I conclude there is an end of that matter. Iam aware he is writing
to you, but he said he should not mention this. 6.30 P.M. Your Box has been just brought to me. Feeling
sure that you would think it right, under the circumstances, I have opened and detained your letter to
Robert Montagu [see 4768]. There is no doubt it is wise, now, to withhold it, but I did not like to do so
without assuring myself that it contained nothing else of importance. I am glad I did so, but, at the same
time ask your pardon for an apparently unwarrantable liberty. In spite of the Morning Post, the Lord
Chelmsford has failed to rouse a feeling that he has been ill used: All, to whom the truth is told, laugh at
him. The Editorial comment in the Standard on “Truth’s” letter, copied into the Pall Mall, puts the matter right. He himself, in the letter I forward, annihilates his main argument in his first letter. H. Lennox
has shown me White’s letter. One or two of my Radical friends have spoken somewhat in the same strain
to me today. Dalglish, one of them, is however obstinately opposed to an increase of the House. He will
even speak against it. This is a bore. He even said that he had rather name no additional Members for
Scotland. That will be the solution of the difficulty, I really begin to think. What a lovely day, even here
... On the whole the tone of public opinion is excellent. Fleming wants you to offer the P.L.B. to Eustace
Cecil.’ H B/IX/F/31.

My dear Lord Abercorn,

In accomplishing the task, wh: the Queen has entrusted to me, of forming a new

service those, who had assisted Lord Derby in the conduct of affairs, &, as far as possible, in the same posts, which he had selected for them. /

But this is not the reason that I appeal to Yr Excell[en]cy to continue to be the
Representative of the Queen in Ireland.

It is because I wish to secure in that / country the presence of a Viceroy, whose
admirable ability, in every respect, has already vindicated Her Majesty’s authority
under almost unprecedented difficulties, & in whose wisdom & resource, will be
found the / best means for the improvement & welfare of the country.

I hope, therefore, my dear Lord, that I may have the satisfaction of informing Her
Majesty, that you have / consented to continue in Ireland your sagacious, popular,
& beneficial rule.’

J.T. Delane Esqr
Dear Delane,
I can’t resist sending you a line of congratulation on the successful manner in wh:
our Chancellor of the Exchequer has been / received."
Do you remember our conversation at Lord Cairns? What you said decided me.
I was always very much for it myself: indeed it was, of course, my own suggestion;
but it / was carped at by commonplace minds, who seemed shocked at the sudden
elevation, & talked of other people as being “looked up to” in the City.

Abercorn, LL of Ireland since 13 July 1866, would continue in that post until 1 December 1868. He would
reply from Dublin Castle on the 29th that, ‘in reply to your very kind and flattering letter, I beg to assure
you that Iam most happy to offer any such services as I can command for your acceptance, and, under
your Government, to continue to represent Her Majesty to the best of my ability in this country.’ H B/

George Ward Hunt would succeed D as chancellor of the exchequer on 29 February. ‘So rapid a rise of so
comparatively young a man, without “family influence,” is, we believe, unprecedented’, the Birmingham
Daily Post would write. Hunt was ‘but 43 years of age, and has only been ten years in Parliament’; he was
assuming ‘an office which is generally given to men of greater age and more experience.’ The Times (2
Mar 1868).

EDITORIAL COMMENT: Osborne paper.

Right Honorable | The Lord Chelmsford Feb 29 1868
Dear Lord Chelmsford,
I received your letter this morning."

I only alluded to your understanding with Lord Derby, because I thought it must
be impressed on your memory, & / did not wish to dwell in detail on circumstances
necessarily of a character not agreeable.

After the allusion to that understanding, & the necessity of my acting on it, the
rest of my letter invited communication. / You could have arranged with me at any
cause for your retirement most to your liking, & you could have responded to my

enquiry.

—

Chelmsford had replied to 4763 on the 28th: ‘I am most anxious upon the termination of my official
life that you should not have any reason to attribute to me any misstatement of circumstances which
could justify your determination not to permit me any longer to hold the Great Seal. I therefore hasten
to correct a part of the letter which I wrote to you upon receiving your communication that it was not
your intention to submit my name to Her Majesty for the custody of the Great Seal in the list of the new
Ministry. I was under the impression that when Lord Cairns was called to the Upper House the arrangement for my quitting the Woolsack in his favor would not be acted upon. But from a letter which I have
received from Knowsley this morning it appears that I was mistaken in this respect. It is right you should
know for your own justification the account which Lord Derby gives of the arrangement. He says “With
regard to the understanding between you and me your recollection is tolerably accurate except that no
definite period was named and certainly not that of two or three years, as neither of us at the time could
contemplate such a term of Office. What I did say upon the two occasions to which you refer was, that
looking to the necessity of strengthening ourselves in the House of Lords I hoped you would not take it
amiss if after a certain time I should ask you to resign the Great Seal in Cairns’s favor. You answered most
kindly that you placed yourself entirely at my disposal but hoped that it might be done in such a manner
as not to cast a slur upon you. I answered that I hoped I should be able to make an arrangement by which
you might have some Office of high rank such as the President of the Council to fall back upon, and had
such opportunity occurred I should probably before now have asked you to act upon our understanding.” It appears therefore that I had no right to question the propriety of the statement in your letter
that the arrangement though delayed was still contemplated by Lord Derby ... if you had recalled to my
recollection the particulars of this arrangement and had intimated to me that your convenience required
it should now be carried out I should readily have consented to resign and make way for Lord Cairns for
whom I have the greatest regard and whose superiority to me in every respect I readily acknowledge. But
the mode in which my dismissal (for I can call it by no other name) was communicated to me places me
in avery different position from that which Lord Derby contemplated in carrying out the arrangement.
The appointment to some other “Office of high rank” is of course out of the question nor do I at all covet
such a distinction. But I cannot help feeling very acutely that the manner in which I have been removed
from my Office has cast a slur upon my reputation against which I am sure Lord Derby would have carefully guarded and which nothing but some mark of Her Majesty’s gracious approval of my services (if they
have been approved) can possibly remove.’ H B/IX/F/87.

Instead of that, from a total misapprehension of my communication, wh: / was
really influenced by delicacy, the public have been invited to our confidential communications, with the usual consequences under such circumstances.”

I shall do nothing to add to the controversy, but shall be always ready to show the
great respect I entertain for you.?

EDITORIAL COMMENT: Osborne paper. Sic: embarassing.

Feb 29 1868
Mr Disraeli with his humble duty to Yr Majesty:

Lord Chelmsford seems already to find, that he is rather in the wrong, &, his visit
today will not, therefore, be embarassing.

He has appealed for facts / to Knowsley, & the decision has been against him.

His letter is candid & apologetical, but Mr Disraeli thinks that some misapprehensions should still be noticed, & he has written a short / & friendly reply, wh: will
meet Lord Chelmsford on his arrival.

He encloses the correspondence for Her Majesty’s approval! & approbation, if
indeed Her Majesty has time, or taste, to attend to such little matters. He / would
not have presumed to do so, had not Her Majesty yesterday* deigned to refer to the
pa circumstances.

2 mp (28 Feb 1868), under the heading “The Lord Chancellor’s Dismissal’, had noted that ‘On Tuesday
afternoon Lord Chelmsford, when he took his seat upon the woolsack, had not been informed that Lord
Derby’s resignation had been accepted by the Queen, and Lord Malmesbuty ... expressed his surprise
that the Lord Chancellor had not previously been made acquainted with it by Mr. Disraeli.’ That evening
Chelmsford had received from D a communication [4754] stating that D ‘could not include Lord Chelmsford in the list about to be submitted to her Majesty for reappointment to the office of Lord Chancellor.
It was in this curt, not courteous, manner that the new Premier marked his sense of the services which
Lord Chelmsford has rendered to the Conservative party’. On this day (29th), mp had printed a letter
from ‘A Barrister’ (dated “Temple, Feb 28.’) complaining about ‘the wholly unprecedented circumstance’ of Chelmsford’s dismissal (‘the mantle so rudely torn’ from his shoulders) and reproaching
D for ‘saddling the public with an unnecessary expenditure ... of £5,000 a year (the amount of an exChancellor’s pension).’

Chemist Michael Faraday, who had died on 25 August 1867, had been receiving a pension of £300 from
the national exchequer. A letter from ‘Y.’ had proposed that it now be conferred upon his widow, ‘a
sacred charge upon the nation’. The Times (21 Jan 1868). Although Faraday and Sarah Barnard (18001879), married on 12 June 1821, were childless, see 4776&n7.

—

Chelmsford would reply on this day (1 March): “When at the close of our conversation yesterday you
signified to me that you would have pleasure in placing my name before Her Majesty for some distinction
to be conferred upon me I did not suppose it would be of the description which you have mentioned
in your letter. I appears to me that the distinction of a Grand Cross of Bath is entirely unsuited to the
position of an ex-Chancellor and that I should suffer in public estimation by accepting it, inasmuch as
it would be the first instance of its being considered to be a suitable recognition of judicial services. You
have placed me under a difficulty in having to decline any distinction which Her Majesty has signified
her gracious intention to confer upon me. But as I must consider that Her Majesty has been moved to
Her gracious intention by your suggestion, I may with more freedom but with perfect respect express
my opinion upon the subject. Iam too old to care for decorations which I can wear only for a few short
years and then they will pass into oblivion. When in one of your letters you informed me that there was
a desire to recognize my services “so as to meet my wishes in a manner which would be agreeable to Her
Majesty” I could not help hoping that Her Majesty might be advised to dignify me with some honor which
would convey to posterity a lasting token of her Royal grace and favor. At the same time I did not think
that it would be becoming or respectful to follow the course proposed to me in your letter announcing
to me that it was not your intention to submit my name to Her Majesty for the custody of the Great Seal
& “suggest some other mode by which Her Majesty might testify the sense of my services.” I may now I
trust be permitted to state that it has not been unusual (especially where the Great Seal has been held
for a second time) to advance the Chancellor to the dignity of an Earldom & I may refer amongst other
instances in recent times to Lord Loughborough, Lord Eldon & Lord Cottenham.’ H B/Ix/F/8g. See

Mar: 1 1868
Mr Disraeli with his humble duty to Yr. Majesty:

He has signified to Sir W. Page Wood Yr Majesty’s pleasure, that the office of Lord
Justice shd. be offered to him.*

He / has signified to Lord Chelmsford, that Yr Majesty has been graciously
pleased to confer on him the distinction of a Grand Cross of the Bath, in recognition of his public services.”

Mr Disraeli proposes that Mr Sclater Booth, Secy. / to the Poor Law Board, shd.
be appointed Secy. to the Treasury. It is an office, that requires great health, capacity of labor, & the power of saying “No” to the numerous jobs daily enforced by
Members of Parliament on both sides, & often adroitly veiled.

It / would be wise to offer the Secretaryship of the Poor Law Board to Lord Eustace Cecil — a very competent man. He wd. probably |refuse! it, but the offer would
be conciliatory & eon, perhaps, conciliating|[.]4

The Cabinet is summoned for three o’ck tomorrow, / when the whole question
of Irish policy will be considered, & definitively arranged.

Lord Stanley has gone down to Knowsley at Lord Derby’s request; but the report
is not unfavorable, only the physicians have declared, that / recovery is impossible
if he either receives, or dictates, letters.®

Sir William Page Wood would reply on this day (1 March) to b’s letter (not found): “The many communications I have received on the mere rumor of my promotion to a higher office corroborate the
impression made by your own proposal of it, that Iam not considered too old [at 67] for the discharge
of its duties — and although (without any affectation) I can say, that it costs me some lingering regrets to
resign some of the contemplated occupations of leisure after retirement, I accept as a duty, and at the
same time sincerely appreciate as a great honor & distinction the high office to which I have been thus
courteously invited.’ H B/IX/F/44. Wood would succeed Cairns as lord justice of appeal and succeed him
as lord chancellor in December 1868. He would become 1st Baron Hatherley, of Down Hatherley, in the
county of Gloucester, on 10 December. The Times (11 Dec 1868).

See 4774&n1.

George Sclater-Booth on this day (1 March) replied to p’s letter (not found) accepting ‘the post which
you are so kind as to offer me ... I will do my best, but shall certainly need the indulgence of those with
whom I am placed in contact at the Treasury and in the House of Commons.’ He would become financial
secretary to the treasury on 4 March. H B/XxX1/B/634.

Cecil, younger brother of Lord Cranborne (who had resigned abruptly in February 1867; see 1x 4338&nz2),
on this day (1 March) at 6 pm would reply to D’s letter (not found) offering him the position of poor law
board secretary. ‘I am sure you will readily interpret my rejection of so flattering an offer, as proceeding, not from any want of appreciation of the honour intended to be conferred upon me, but from the
disinclination that I have of undertaking at the present moment the responsible duties of a Government
Office.’ H B/IX/F/41.

For the 2 March cabinet, see 4776n10.

Stanley, whose ‘report’ to D has not been found, at Knowsley on this day (1 March) had noted: ‘Found
Ld D. wonderfully recovered, his spirits excellent, voice clear and strong, but he is still very weak in the
limbs. He talked to me of the Queen’s way of writing to him, about which he was at first very sore: but I
think he now understands her nature. She is civil to persons in power under her, whose good will contributes to her comfort (and not always to them): but sees no reason for wasting civility on those who can
no longer be of use to her.’ Disraeli, Derby 331.

Mr Disraeli with his humble duty to Yr Majesty:

Sir W.P. Wood has accepted Yr Majesty’s gracious offer. It was made on Sunday

Chancellor twenty years; Lord Cottenham, / a very doubtful promotion, had at
least inherited two large family fortunes, & was very rich.°

“plain undistinguished man” as “one of the most curious instances of elevation that ever occurred” (Greville Memoirs, 3.328) ... On 27 May 1850 he abruptly resigned, to be granted in the following month the

My Lord,"
The lamented illness of Lord Derby having compelled his retirement from the head
of affairs, I have been entrusted by Her Majesty with the formation of a New Administration.

8 Sir James Young Simpson (see ng) on 20 February had written to the Duchess of Atholl requesting a
pension for Brewster’s widow and daughter (see n6), who had been ‘left very, very poorly provided for;
while the children of his first marriage are well off’. Writing to MA on the 26th asking for her influence,
Simpson had compared their case to that of Mrs Faraday and her niece (see n7). He would write to D on
8 March thanking him for Lady Brewster’s £200 pension. H B/C/IX/10a,d,h.

9 Sir James Young Simpson (1811-1870), 1st Bt 1866, medical studies at the University of Edinburgh 1827,
licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh 1830 and Mp in 1832, was senior president of
the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh 1835, appointed to the City Lying-in Hospital in Edinburgh 1836,
chair of midwifery at the University of Edinburgh 1839, one of the Queen’s physicians for Scotland 1847
and president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh 1850. Simpson advocated obstetric anaesthesia (chloroform), breastfeeding, the medical education of women and the health-giving properties of
red wine.

10 Stanley on the 3rd would summarize this day’s (2nd) ‘cabinet on Irish affairs. We discussed education,
land, church; the latter subject slightly, the two first fully. It was impossible for anything to be more
orderly and well managed than the proceedings: which was not formerly the case. I kept a note of what
passed, but the substance was, that we agreed without dissentients to Mayo’s plan for a Catholic college,
to have a charter: and also to his bringing in a bill including the greater part of what was in that of last
year, and at the same time proposing the appointment of a new Devon commission. The church question
was approached with great caution, Cairns being known to have strong opinions upon it. The general
wish seemed to be, to commit ourselves as little as possible, and endeavour to tide over the present session, leaving church matters to be dealt with by the new parliament.’ About the cabinet on the 3rd he
would record: ‘the business almost exclusively Irish: Catholic University: land question: church: etc. The
most important decision come to was to support, at least not to oppose, the repeal of the eccles. titles act.
(I have kept a note of the proceedings.)’ Disraeli, Derby 331.

circular to each Peer who receives Colvilles Summons to ask him to continue to you the same support
wh he gave Ld Derby N.B. Direct the envelopes yrself or at all events put yr Autograph Signature in the

In making this announcement to your Lordship, permit me to express / an earnest hope, that you will continue, to the present Government, the same measure of
support, which you accorded to the last.

I should hardly presume to make such a request, had I not the consolation of feeling, that Iam supported by the confidence of Lord Derby.

Right Honorable | The Lord Chancellor Mar 2 1868
My dear Ld Chancellor,
I forgot, in the Cabinet to day, to speak to you about the V. Chan[ce]llLorshi] p. I
don’t know, whether it is in yr gift, or mine; / & dont care. We are the same, & I trust
always shall be: but I hear very bad accounts, & from the other side, of Bagallay’s
chance of keeping the seat for us. Clive says / it is hopeless."

Now we must not lose another seat, or we really shall tempt the enemy to action.

I was anything but displeased with the tone of the Cabinet today / on the crucial
question.” I think you & I may not only steer the ship thro’ all the difficulties — but
in time — which is wanted — tranquillise a chronic irritation.4

Richard Baggallay would retain his seat as Mp (C) for Hereford at the election in September 1868 upon
his appointment as solicitor-general, but would be defeated for the second seat by J.W.S. Wylie (L) on 17
November. George Clive (L) would be re-elected for Hereford on that date.

3 Cairns on this day (2nd) would reply that “The office of VC is, as I understand, in your gift. I had hoped
from what Taylor, & from what Baggallay in his letter to Taylor, said, that the seat was reasonably safe. I
am very sorry it is not: but I agree with you that at the starting of a new Government it wd. be an awkward
blow to lose another seat. Baggalay wd. make a very good V.C. but if you think your information as to
the seat is trustworthy, I don’t see what can be done, but that Taylor shd. explain the case to Baggallay &
smooth him over. In the public & professional view, [George Markham] Giffard wd. be an appointment
even better than Baggallay. Taylor was to have some information as to Hereford tonight. I am sure the
Cabinet came to the only resolution possible for a Conservative Government. Much will depend on the
very words used in the Ho of Commons. I think it wd. be desirable even in hinting at a Scheme wch. wd.
ameliorate the position of R.C. & Presbytn. Ministers, to put it that this was for the new Parlt., & not for
the present Parlt. or for the Government to determine. If Gladstone & his friends go for anything like Ld
Russell’s proposition they will fail signally. If they throw it over, & go for complete disendowment of every
body, they may catch voluntaries, radicals & anti-popery men, & make a formidable Phalanx. H B/xx/
